my advice to mp3 buyers : consider how much storage space you will need , then try and listen before you buy -- mp3 players can only fully evaluated by holding and listening to them .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O***PRP$ NN IN NN NNS : VB WRB JJ NN NN PRP MD VB , RB VB CC VB IN PRP VBP : NN NNS MD RB RB VBN IN VBG CC VBG IN PRP .

finally the software ASPECT#2d to put all the songs into it is vastly inferior to itunes on two levels , first it is poorly integrated into the overall player and clunky to use especially with tagging and second the wma audio format sucks , flat out sucks in terms of sound quality compared with the vastly superior aac format the apple ipod uses and it sticks you with one of the sub par paid music services such as napster instead of allowing to use the itunes store , which , if you ever plan to pay for your music , is by far the best .***O O T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG T-NEG T-NEG O O O O O O O O T-NEG T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O***RB DT NN .
