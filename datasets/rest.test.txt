When the bill came , nothing was comped , so I told the manager very politely that we were willing to pay for the wine , but I did n't think I should have to pay for food with a maggot in it .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O***WRB DT NN VBD , NN VBD VBN , CC PRP VBD DT NN RB RB IN PRP VBD JJ TO VB IN DT NN , CC PRP VBD RB VB PRP MD VB TO VB IN NN IN DT NN IN PRP .

This review is for the Southglen location which is not listed in Citysearch , I wish this review would make a difference enough for it to be addressed by management but Snooze has people climbing over each other for a chance to eat at this overpriced restaurant with mediocre food and service , so this review as well as the other negative ones for their Larimer location will go unaddressed .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O***DT NN VBZ IN DT NNP NN WDT VBZ RB VBN IN NNP , PRP VBP DT NN MD VB DT NN JJ IN PRP TO VB VBN IN NN CC NNP VBZ NNS VBG IN DT JJ IN DT NN TO VB IN DT JJ NN IN JJ NN CC NN , CC DT NN RB RB IN DT JJ JJ NNS IN PRP$ NNP NN MD VB JJ .
The presentation of Snooze is excellent and it is one of those places that you feel more sophisticated just for being there ; but peel back the layers and you have an overpriced IHOP with a high brow menu .***O O O T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG O***DT NN IN NNP VBZ JJ CC PRP VBZ CD IN DT NNS WDT PRP VBP RBR JJ RB IN VBG RB : CC VB RP DT NNS CC PRP VBP DT JJ NNP IN DT JJ NN NN .

The pancakes were certainly inventive but $ 850 for 3 , 6 pancakes one of them was more like 5 in the pancake flight sample of 3 different pancakes is well over - priced .***O T-POS O O O O O O O O O O T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-POS O O O O O O***DT NNS VBD RB JJ CC $ CD IN CD , CD VBZ CD IN PRP VBD JJR IN CD IN DT NN NN NN IN CD JJ NNS VBZ RB RB HYPH VBN .

On my meal I had to send back my eggs for a simple request of breaking the yokes before cooking , and would have had to send them back again if I had n't rejected the meal all together .***O O T-NEG O O O O O O T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG O O O***IN PRP$ NN PRP VBD TO VB RB PRP$ NNS IN DT JJ NN IN VBG DT NNS IN NN , CC MD VB VBN TO VB PRP RB RB IN PRP VBD RB VBN DT NN RB RB .
I rejected it because in the process of attempting to fix the eggs they broke something else in the dish and I was too frustrated to continue .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG O O O O O O O O***PRP VBD PRP IN IN DT NN IN VBG TO VB DT NNS PRP VBD NN RB IN DT NN CC PRP VBD RB JJ TO VB .
