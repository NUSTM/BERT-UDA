source***I ' m from England , and Haru 's was the best I had in NYC .
source***I would go back .
target***The reality was , it heated up very quickly , and took way too long to do simple things , like opening my Documents folder .
target***Acer wo n't replace the laptop .
target***The programs are great , like iphoto love the editing capabilities , imail which can incorporate with the address book on the ipod and ipad , imovie , etc .
target***I use a cooling pad but it does n't help .
target***I bought the netbook because it was smaller and lighter for me to carry around .
target***Bottom line , I doubt you 'd be overly disappointed if you invest in this machine .
target***The black model also has a very nice seamless appearance , one of the better looking notebooks I ' ve seen .
source***Fluke sashimi drizzled with jalapeno - lime olive oil , the fruit of the oil nicely highlighting the fish 's sweetness .
source***Though you will undoubtedly be seated at a table with what seems like barely enough room no matter what the size of your party , the warm atomosphere is worth the cramped quarters you 'll have fun and forgot about the tight spot you 're in .
source***After being told that our party of three would be seated in 10 minutes and watching other parties multiples of 2 and higher seated for 40 minutes , the three of us were squished into a small 2-person table .
target***WIth the upgraded memory , the MacBook Pro never has an issue running many many applications at once !
target***I find myself using the 10-key more than I thought I would .
source***We were fans of the half - price Saturday night option until some inedible squid during a recent visit .
source***Great food , great lay out and awesome service .
target***The Toshiba Satellite laptop is DESIGNED to fail !
target***If upgrade is possible to the full Windows 7 , then I will truly be a very happy geek .
source***Delicious crab cakes too .
source***for my birthday and we had an excellent time .
target***It freezes , and it always shows that there is an error , so I have to restart it a few times every time I use it .
source***The food was boring and expensive .
target***But the quality , in general was less than the worth of the cheap laptop .
target***As a graphic arts a retired instructor I still love to play with the graphic with photos and clip art .
target***Its fast , has High definition quality in the videos .
source***Inside is a little cramped , but to be expected .
source***If you want to save some money , do n't go here .
source***The food is decent at best , and the ambience , well , it 's a matter of opinion , some may consider it to be a sweet thing , I thought it was just annoying .
source***I would definitely go back - if only for some of those exotic martinis on the blackboard .
target***I have had this laptop for a few months now and i would say i m pretty satisfied .
target***STOPPED BOOTING UP less than a week after my one - year warranty was up .
target***while the keyboard itself is alright , the plate around it is cheap plastic and makes a hollow sound when using the mouse command buttons .
target***Great OS , fabulous improvements to the existing line bumping up the processor speed and adding the thunderbolt port .
source***The food was great and the service was even better .
source***Went there last night for 2 year anniversery , and was n't all that impressed .
source***The table next to us asked if he crushed the grapes himself when their long overdue bottle of wine finally arrived .
source***It is kinda nosiy and the tables are close together but it 's still a beautiful place to enjoy a nice dinner .
source***Our last time there a few weeks ago was early at 5 pm and it was very crowded and noisy .
target***And the screen on this thing is absolutely amazing for high quality videos and movies and gaming .
source***wow ! how have i missed this one , tried Long Tan last week for the first time and now know what the NY TIMES and many more in the neighborhood already knew .
target***Games being the main issue .
source***My wife had the fried shrimp which are huge and loved it .
target***I guess he was the technical person .
target***go for it !
source***Unless you are eating in the Pizzeria side of this place , and are not in a rush , this place is a bad idea .
source***The service , wine selection , ambiance are all outstanding and deserve recognition .
source***We always go there on the weekends and leave extremely full and satisfied .
target***-they lost my laptop for a month
target***everything about a mac is wonderful , it takes a little used to learning and getting used to the new system , but you will learn fast and its all worth it .
target***Do you think the shop will give me a new set ? ? It will NOT !
source***We had Pam 's special fried fish and it was amazing .
target***I could not find a phone number anywhere to call an actual live person for tech support and had to result the their online chat .
source***When my dessert came , there was a candle in it , not because anyone asked for one , but because the waiter must have seen me opening my birthday card and gift , and said he knew it was a special occassion of some sort .
target***Stay away from Envy .
source***The spicy Tuna roll is huge and probably the best that I ' ve had at this price range .
source***Three strikes and this restaurant is out .
target***Speakers does n't sound that great .
source***A cool place to hang with your friends for a couple of healthy drinks and desserts .
source***and never strayed .
source***Plus , on Wednesday nights the house wine is unlimited !
target***I can actually get work done with this MAC , and not fight with it like my tired old PC laptop .
source***I found it on a cold night , the perfect spot to warm up .
source***Everything is delicious , though , my gf and I come here once a week sometimes you will get addicted !
target***I should have been more observant .
target**** 2 weeks after giving the computer for repair*-Called headquarters , they report that they have not looked at it yet but it is on the top of the stack .
source***Have frequented ino for several years and the food remains excellent .
source***Bleecker St Pizza is the best !
target***I bought it during the recent Comex IT show .
source***Great wine , great food .
source***It 's a small cute restaurant .
source***We have been to Montparnasse many times and return often for good reason .
target***This is my first Dell I heard their customer service was lacking and that they were working on improving it !
source***too large for just two people but nothing was left .
source***Even if the food was n't this good , the garden is a great place to sit outside and relax .
source***The appetizers are just OK and the main courses were decidedly subpar .
source***this place is amazingly bad .
target***It has everything I would need for a home computer .
source***The lamb meat was under - cooked and EXTRMELY CHEWY .
target***One drawback , I wish the keys were backlit .
source***What came to our table was burned beyond recognition and stringy .
target***The design is awesome , quality is unprecedented .
target***I would recommend Mac , and do , to anyone looking to buy a new computer .
source***Go there on an empty stomach and leave feeling like a baby Veal Calfok bad joke , but you will see .
target***I did an internet search and this is a very common problem with this laptop .
target***But the arm velcro is torn after one use .
target***Everything is so easy to use , Mac software is just so much simpler than Microsoft software .
source***The parathas and kebabs are made when ordered ensuring a level of freshness that is unsurpassed .
source***Definitely not worth the price !
source***This was a great surprise .
source***We only ordered desserts and drinks , but no refills were offered .
target***It has happened again and I ' m being told that it 's $ 175 .
target***Toshiba does not send any one out unless you have paid extra to have the on site repair done .
target***So , if you 're thinking of a laptop , I would heartily recommend theApple 133 MacBook Pro Notebook Computer Z0J80001 Notebook for all your needs ! .
target***I m glad that it has such great features in it .
target***First , it does not have a push button to open the lid .
target***Currently if I use the laptop I ca n't sit it on my lap because it will burn my legs .
source***Went on a double date with friend and his girlfriend for a few drinks and appetizers .
source***I have been to Roth 's twice and both times were very disappointing .
source***In such a crappy part of town to find a good value for lunch , this place is great .
target***I took it back for a full refund .
source***go here for the drinks !
source***I have never better enjoyed humble root vegetables or a mushroom consomme , and this chef accomplishes without fats .
target***When calling Dell for help , reurn , or a new computer they were not useful and left it up to myself to figure out what to do with it .
target***i am a huge computer person i love anykind of computer that works well , but when i got this one i was so happy with the way it works and how it runs its amazing .
source***I ' ve lived in NYC all my life and had never before seen so many waterbugs in one place except in a really bad dream .
target***I would recommend this computer to anyone searching for the perfect laptop , and the battery life is amazing .
source***However , they ' ve got the most amazing pastrami and the soups hit the spot .
target***It 's now all commodity hardware .
source***Fabulous service , fantastic food , and a chilled out atmosphere and environment .
target***The games included are very good games .
source***Like others have said , do n't expect the restaurant to make a nite out romantic for you and yes , a busy restaurant may require you to wait .
target***There are a few flaws as well that I noticed .
source***The staff is very attentive and we can almost always get a table .
source***The food is amazing ! ! ! !
source***I was here a few weeks back and we had the worst customer service experience at a restaurant ever .
source***The food came out wrong , the waiter was no where to be found and the wine showed up at the end of the meal .
target***The screen almost looked like a barcode when it froze .
source***ALWAYS full with tourists especially because of it 's close proximity to Rockefeller Center .
target***big mistake !
target***I had to pay for the shipping !
target***I think this ps was manufactured in the mid 90 's .
source***Definite go if you 're used to good Indian restaurant food from abroad .
target***This computer is really fast and I ' m shocked as to how easy it is to get used to .
target***Then it ceased charging at all .
target***not the day received .
source***Some of the finest latin women you 'll see in your life hang out at Jimmy 's .
source***I ordered the crab cocktail and it was soaked in a lime juice concoction where all you could taste was the lime .
source***That 's why you have to pay more for that .
target***which Apple does n't offer , is why I bought my MacBook at Best Buy .
source***The worst excuse for Japanese food I ' ve ever encountered .
target***and plenty of storage with 250 gbthough I will upgrade this and the ram .
target***We also use Paralles so we can run virtual machines of Windows XP Professional , Windows 7 Home Premium , Windows Server Enterprise 2003 , and Windows Server 2008 Enterprise .
source***I stumbled upon this second floor walk - up two Fridays ago when I was with two friends in town from LA Being serious sushi lovers , we sat at the sushi bar to be closer to the action .
target***Acer was no help and Garmin could not determine the problemafter spending about 2 hours with me , so I returned it and purchased a Toshiba R700 that seems even nicer and I was able to load all of my software with no problem .
source***The only positive was the wait staff , which was prompt , knowledgable , and likeable .
target***My MacBook is faster than any comparable PC .
target***Toshiba knows there is a manufacturing defect but will not acknowledge it .
target***I think just going from PC to Mac has gotten me totally spoiled and I ca n't imagine ever going back .
source***We did n't even see a menu , as our waiter described both the specials and the main dishes .
target***I got assurances from 2 different people that the remaining 10 months of my warranty would transfer to the new computer .
target***THE MOTHERBOARD IS DEAD !
target***I absolutely love my mac !
target***Ever since I bought this laptop , so far I ' ve experience nothing but constant break downs of the laptop and bad customer services I received over the phone with toshiba customer services hotlines .
source***La Rosa is connected by a swinging door to the Mexican restaurant Pacifico .
source***We were not disappointed .
target***It 's even easy to hook up to other wireless networks .
target***I am most impressed with the programming , including the iPhoto .
source***However , service was as plain as sesame crusted Salmon I had .
source***As I made the title , it 's an affordable restaurant for great taste .
source***They even have a section in the menu called American Chinese food !
source***If you 're craving for Haru 's great food , especially the House Roll , but ca n't stand the wait building outisde , head across the street to their Sake Bar !
target***Looks nice , but has a horribly cheap feel .
source***I think the restaurant was too loud when full to be romantic .
source***My friends and I were on vacation in NY and was referred to Chance by a friend .
target***I feel that enough people have Macs these days and that companies need to start making things more compatable than they used to be .
target***The driver updates do n't fix the issue , very frustrating .
source***We , there were four of us , arrived at noon , the place was empty , and the staff acted like we were imposing on them and they were very rude .
target***The AC power port becomes loose over time
target***I think this will happen to any new version of computer / phone released and I need to wait for the next set of updates to have all of this fixed .
target***-I give up on my data , I just want a computer reasonably fast .
target***The only pro to this computer is it was under $ 600 !
target***Returned laptop for a 4th repair and it came back but now would lock up and randomly reboot frequently making the laptop unusable .
target***The salesman talked us into this computer away from another we were looking at and we have had nothing but problems with software problems and just not happy with it .
target***I was constantly having to roll back the computer after doing updates .
target***My only other complaint is that it gets really hot .
source***Great food spinach and corn dumplings and massamman curry , very friendly and no nonsense service and a clean and funky bathroom .
source***My husband and I both ordered the Steak , medium .
target***I really like the Mac 154 in Notebook , but its very pricey .
target***All in all , a very disappointing experience except that I learned how good the Geek Squad is and also Customer Service .
source***Came looking for this place because I heard good things .
target***Do n't buy this model .
target***The computer itself was fast , ran smoothly , and had no problems .
target***It gets stuck all of the time you use it , and you have to keep tapping on it to get it to work .
target***Finally , I could n't take it anymore and ordered my Apple .
target***I hate the display screen and I have done everything I could do the change it .
target***taking it back less than 24 hours of purchase
source***Good spreads , great beverage selections and bagels really tasty .
target***And inconvenient !
target***Highly recommend for daily use .
target***I am taking back today .
target***A MONTH LATER , we reinstall the OS ( Vista ) .
target***They only stay charged a little over an hour .
source***The Dim Sum was so - so , but not spectacular .
target***A key contributor that led me to Mac is the art aspect .
source***The hot and sour soup was unbearably hot and tasted of only pepper and nothing else .
target***Have not yet needed any customer support with this yet so to me that is a great thing , which is leaps and bounds ahead of PC in my opinion .
source***Anyone who ever dined at a thai restaurant is in for a huge disappointment .
target***returned it to walmart .
source***Open late well as late as I ever got there and I ' m a night person
target***The service I received from Toshiba went above and beyond the call of duty .
source***Love the Jazz bands on Fri and Sat .
source***Diner food at bistro prices is a bummer .
target***If you shop around in the current market you can find a much better deal .
target***This one has had the same effect .
target***I will stack it up against laptops that cost twice as much any day .
target***I am just ONE of the million customers .
target***I was very worried about making the two compatible but literally , it was so simple I was almost worried that I was doing something wrong .
target***Two , owning a 17 inmac book gives the flexibility to sit anywhere you want without worry about bother anyone .
source***Always busy but fast moving .
target***I own other Macs but always find myself navigation to the MacBook Pro to get my work done .
source***Big Wong gets big Ups for a fine establishment .
source***We were planning to get dessert but the waitress basically through the bill at us before we had a chance to order .
target***I run Dreamweaver , Final Cut Pro 7 , Photoshop , Safari , Firefox , MSN Messenger and a few other applications constantly at the same time .
source***This is an amazing place to try some roti rolls .
source***So I ' ve never actually been to M proper , but I ' ve had it delivered a few times .
source***The sweet lassi was excellent as was the lamb chettinad and the garlic naan but the rasamalai was forgettable .
source***Buon appetito !
source***A great way to make some money is to buy a case of snapple from Costco and sell it right outside for only $ 250 .
source***There is nothing more pleasant than that .
target***It 's more expensive but well worth it in the long run .
source***So , the menu is written in chalk above your head and it all sounds delicious .
source***I work near - by , and they have the BEST oatmeal in the neighborhood not a packaged or quick - cooked item .
source***I do n't like Indian food too much and this was delicious , however you want to factor that into the equation .
source***I would not recommend this place to anyone .
target***After years of using PCs , a new Mac user is basically forced to re - learn how to use a computer .
source***Too bad the food was n't of the same heritage .
target***Sometimes the screen even goes black on this computer .
source***Coming from Boston this place is like Emma 's Pizza in Kendall Square in Cambridge although they have more funky toppings !
source***The dim sum here is only so - so .
source***Anyway , this is the last time I cross the williamsburg .
target***I have only had PCs with Windows before so this takes a little getting use to .
target***This was the second computer and brand bought that day .
target***I practically have a new laptop with all the fixes they have done !
target***Sells for the same as a netbook without sacrificing size .
source***I ' ve been living in the Columbia University area for about 10 years with 3 kids , now in their teens .
source***The people that work there are always so friendly you forget you are in New York sometimes .
target***The SATA controller is the motherboard chip that lets the CPU talk to the hard drive .
source***VT is what baby pizzas hope to be when they grow up .
source***In any event , even though its a bit on the pricey side , we still love this restaurant and will definitely go back .
source***None of that yucky whipped stuff .
target***Comfterbale to use light easy to transport .
target***But , Mac makes the switch from PC to Mac easy .
source***Took my mom for Mother 's Day , and the maitre d ' was pretty rude .
source***Check it out
source***We bring in a party of ten or so every week .
target***i had the bulk of problems with my lap top within the first six months .
target***I have loved this since i took it out of the box .
source***Shockingly easy to throw a group dinner here , simple contract , deposit only to hold the date the entire 2nd fl mezz for our grp of 20 .
target***Wasted me at least 8 hours of installation time .
target***lots of extra space but the keyboard is ridiculously small .
source***To be completely fair , the only redeeming factor was the food , which was above average , but could n't make up for all the other deficiencies of Teodora .
target***My daughter uses it for games , email , facebook , pictures and music .
source***I 'd definitely recommend this little place .
source***they live up to the thai way of living .
source***Several of the dim sum orders had about 6 - 8 pieces .
target***The casing of the power cord fried and shocked my husband when he pulled it out of the socket .
source***One would think we 'd get an apology or complimentary drinks , instead , we got a snobby waiter would n't even take our order for 15 minutes and gave us lip when we asked him to do so .
source***The sicilian is my favorite it is moist not dry like most places but all their pizza is great !
target***was a great deal i will give that .
target***Back then my entire family was Devoted to the Sony name .
target***I purchased it this year when my old HP laptop finally died and I was looking for something smaller and lighter than a laptop to carry around for classes and traveling .
target***It was a total Dhell experience that I will never repeat .
target***Small and light weight .
source***This is a fun restaurant to go to .
target***But no one could tell me when my part would be shipped nor could they tell me where to buy it ON THEIR WEBSITE ! ! !
source***The restaurant is dark and not very attractive and then you have spot lights shining on you putting you in the worst light possible , reaching for sunglasses .
source***And forget what you read under me , the atmosphere is n't that bad either .
source***This is a wonderful place on all stand points especially value ofr money .
source***Found service above average , but that could be because we were 13 of us .
source***We could have made a meal of the yummy dumplings from the dumpling menu .
target***Best Buy ended up junking the computer and giving me a replacement computer .
target***I spoke to 4 different people and was told they needed to transfer me to a 5th person !
source***The best Chicken pad tai , I ' ve ever had .
source***You can even get packages of the chutneys to stock your fridge !
target***i love the size of the computer since i play games on it .
source***Winnie and her staff are the best crew you can find serving you .
target***When you call tech support you were routed to someone who was in another country and did not know what they were doing .
source***When we sat , we got great and fast service .
source***While the $ 20 entree range is not overly expensive , in New York City , there is definitely better food in that range , and so Sapphire , despite it 's lovely atmosphere , will most likely not be a restaurant to which I will return .
target***It 's still beautiful and has better color reproduction than I could ever expect from a notebook .
source***The lunch special is an asbolute steal .
target***Of course , for a student , weight is always an issue .
source***I recommend this place to everyone who asks me where to go for a good meal .
source***Aside from the rushed service , we were very impressed with the food and the drinks .
source***It 's really a takeaway place , I would n't sit if I could take it home .
target***I could not even put my entire music collection on this garabage .
source***it 's a perfect place to have a amanzing indian food .
source***This is my favorite Italian restaurant in all of New York City .
target***Mac also has many apps and programs that are quite cheap or free .
target***Not worth it one bit .
source***It was a very nice surprise .
target***Then HP sends it back to me with the hardware screwed up , not able to connect .
target***Memory is upgradable .
target***The screen is nice , side view angles are pretty good .
source***No food snobs allowed , this place is for people who appreciate good food .
source***I had the black cod with yuzu sauce , which was wonderful .
target***I have had at least eight Toshiba laptops , and they have been outstanding , including this one .
source***When I called this morning , I did n't think I would be able to get in at 12 , but I was able to get in , along with four other guests .
target***The rep did not even answer my question , I had to ask him , if he understood what I ask or if he spoke english because he did n't even try to acknowledge my question .
source***Their calzones are horrific , bad , vomit - inducing , YUCK .
target***But enough about that , I am an Apple convert for life .
target***Let 's just get this out of the way , I love Apple !
target***I ' m having the laptop returned unrepaired since paying $ 176 every 3 months just is n't worth it that 's about how long the port seems to last .
source***I ve been to many Thai restaurants in Manhattan before , and Toons is by far the best Thai food I ve had except for my mom 's of course .
target***The video chat is the only thing that is iffy about it but i m sure once they unpdate the next version on the macbook book the quality of it will be better .
target***I found this laptop on sale for under 6000 at Best Buy which was a great deal !
source***During our meal , the management came over and checked on us and even bought us a round of drinks .
source***OU MUST TRY THIS RESTAURANT .
source***Food was very good as well , considering that we tried the budget selection though I wish the pork belly that I ordered was roasted a bit longer , so that fat was more of a melt - in - your - mouth experience .
source***Great selection of wine , and seafood .
target***5 months dead again .
target***Also kinda loud when the fan was running .
target***also you may need to charge it once a day , if for medium use every thing fast and easy with mac the size and look is the most feature that attracted me to it .
target***If you are a person like me , more on the creative side , the mac has something for you too .
target***Meets my needs perfectly and is light enough for this senior to carry without affecting my arthritis .
source***Now it 's so crowded and loud you ca n't even talk to the person next to you .
source***There 's nice and quiet , small but enough for 6 or more .
target***I ' ve had the MacBook Pro 15 for about three weeks , and it really is a great computer .
target***My MacBook Pro is no exception .
source***Rao is a good restaurant , but it 's nothing special .
source***Amazing !
source***The dosas are skimpy , unattractive and drip with grease , and personally I 'd drink popcorn topping before I 'd eat another one of these .
target***Maximum sound is n't nearly as loud as it should be .
target***From the moment I opened the box to the present it has been a great joy .
source***When we notified him that he did n't mention the specials , he did n't apologize but let us know that we made a very good decision regardless .
target***It has a lot of memory and a great battery life .
target***The screen is a little glary , and I hated the clicking buttons , but I got used to them .
target***EVENTUALLY we pushed hard enough to convince them that this was the MACHINE that was causing the problems .
source***I 'd highly recommend it for a special occasion - it provides and intimate setting and nice service .
source***The wine list is extensive and can easily hike up an otherwise reasonably priced meal .
source***Hurley 's is like Cheers where everyone knows your name and they are ACTUALLY glad you came .
target***Me and my boyfriend bought the Gateway NV78 in nov of 09 .
target***And if you have a iphone or ipod touch you can connect and download songs to it at high speed .
target***I should have spent an extra hundred bucks and got a full sized computer .
target***Some features are nt friendly volume wheel , sound quality , etc .
target***The battery is really long .
target***As a lifelong Windows user , I was extremely pleased to make the change to Mac .
source***My husband said he could ' ve eaten several more , the portion was fine for me he even exclaimed that the french fries were the best he has had .
target***I like the laptop overall .
target***Quality Display I love HP , , it 's the only computer / printer we will buy .
source***I have been a longtime fan of Holy Basil in the East Village , and while I do believe their food has slightly slipped in quality , I have been hesitant to be disloyal .
target***I ' m glad I made the choice to switch and buy this MAC .
target***Moral of the story , -Do not buy anything from companies that do not respect their customers .
target***I have been a PC user since middle school , but in my mid twenties I decided to convert to the dark side , or should I say the brighter side of life .
target***I bought it to use in college and it is perfect .
target***Very long - life battery up to 10 - 11 hours depending on how you configure power level settings .
source***I had the tuna tartare with sake , mushroom ravioli with pinot noir , and the chocolate sampler with a dessert wine for $ 49 .
source***We arrived for dinner expecting to be impressed by a place that has an impressive past , but , that 's just it - the PAST !
target***Enough said .
source***My husband and I ate here after reading reviews here as well as hobokenicom .
target***I only used it to browse the internet and and I do n't know how many times it has spontaniously shut down and it is just a blank screen now .
target***I love it !
source***Food and service was okay .
source***This place is really trendi but they have forgotten about the most important part of a restaurant , the food .
target***I had never owned a Mac before ;
source***Great idea and base for restaurant , but work on the details , people who think this was good need to go back to the shore towns and rethink what it should have tasted like .
target***But you must get the 15 inch .
source***We ' ve never had any problems with the staff but maybe we ' ve been lucky ?
source***It 's the perfect restaurant for NY life style , it got cool design , awsome drinks and food and lot 's of good looking people eating and hanging at the pink bar .
target***I made the right decision .
target***Was this product worth my time and money to ever want to purchase another products that is toshiba or relating to toshiba ? Probably not ever again .
source***We were then shooed inside .
source***In fact , you ca n't miss it .
target***BOUGHT FROM WAL - MART , I BELIEVE THAT THIS LAPTOP WAS A REPAIRED ITEM .
source***If you do n't mind all that noise then go to the Chart House .
target***I ' m new , just switched from years of PC frustration .
source***Went here last night and had a pleasant experience .
target***Love the graphics , awesome programs including Garageband , and really cool default background .
target***Its not just slow on the internet , its slow in general .
source***Problem is nothing at Prune is particularly memorable .
source***You can not go wrong with this place .
source***My six year old loved it .
target***Compared to similarly spec 'd PCs , this machine is good value , well built and works easily right out of the box .
target***I love how easy every thing is to do on my Apple products .
source***The seating was if they were trying to get the maximum amount of people into the restaurant , so be nice to your neighbor when you dine here .
target***Here we are another year later and the computer is doing the same thing .
source***I highly recommend it .
source***It is not a place for tourists or someone who has never dined in Bay Ridge .
source***My girlfiends and I ate at OG again last night .
source***Try the Pad Se - Ew or Chicken with Cashew Nuts for a memorable and repeatable experience .
target***Your cursor will end up all over the freaking place , , , it 's not uncommon for me to accidentally delete words , sentences , paragraphs because of this mousepad .
target***I think part of the problem with this computer is Vista , yet I know Vista is n't the entire issue because my latest purchase was my Acer and it also has Vista I should have waited the few months to get the next operating system .
target***Oh and if that s not bad enough it does n't come with a recovery cd so you can make one if you know how to or buy one if you buy it the cost is $ 25 for two cds .
target***Later it held zero charge and its replacement worked for less than three months .
target***I connect a LaCie 2Big external drive via the firewire 800 interface , which is useful for Time Machine .
target***He has replaced his hard drive twice and of course has had to pay for antivirus software every year .
source***Me and my girls will definitely go back .
target***it was shooting sparks !
source***But they ' ve done a really nice job of offering all the typical pizzeria faves plus some terrific specials like the Godmother pizza ( a sort of traditional flat pizza with an olive oil - brushed crust and less tomato sauce than usual ) .
target***So this was great for me .
source***I have lived in NY for many years and have dined at many restaraunts .
target***But reasons we chose this Apple computer .
source***It 's like you are transported to the Italian countryside , very romantic and filled with antiques .
target***Still pretty pricey , but I ' ve been putting off money for a while as a little Macbook Fund , and finally got to use it .
source***There was a long wait for a table outside , but it was a little too hot in the sun anyway so our insde table was very nice .
target***this computer is a little more expensive than any pc but it will last you longer and it worth every penny .
target***I loved the netbook minus the fact that it was windows OS until this started happening .
source***The red curry is weak and tasteless , the pad thai is stuck together and lumpy , the rice is often overcooked , and the seafood is pretty sketchy .
target***In my opinion it was not as user friendly as I expected either .
source***His wife Tanya , the hostess , completes the comforting atmosphere by being delightfully warm and gracious .
source***Best Pastrami I ever had and great portion without being ridiculous .
target***And this is n't just my one experine .
target***Spent 2 hours on phone with HP Technical Support .
target***It works great for general internet use , Microsoft Office apps , home bookkeeping , etc .
target***I got my MacBook Pro because I wanted to do all the stuff I need to do without worrying about the system quitting on me or freezing for a few minutes .
source***The restaurant was packed at first , so we waited at the bar for about 20 minutes before we were seated .
source***Try the crunchy tuna , it is to die for .
source***So , if yo really do n't care who is sittingnext to you , which is about 2 inches away , I would say try it .
source***We were very disappointed .
source***IT IS WHAT MODERN CUISINE IS ALL ABOUT .
target***Luckily , Dell said they would replace my laptop with a new one , but instead I got a refund and bought a mac .
target***Overall , Poor , Features , Average , Performance , Poor , Battery Life , Excellent , Price , Poor
source***My boyfriend had the New England Chowder it was good but I think the award should go to the Lobster Bisque .
target***I love everything about it .
target***It caught a virus that completely wiped out my hard drive in a matter of hours .
source***Ambience is delightful , service impeccable .
target***I my wife is also now the proud owner of a Macbook as well !
target***I love it so much .
source***I have never been disappointed but their true strength lays in their amazingly delicious and cheap lunch specials .
target***upon giving them the serial number the first thing I was told , was that it was out of warranty and I could pay to have it repaired .
target***I ' ve owned this labtop for less then two months , already the mouse button has broke .
target***I was informed that I need to call some 0900 number first .
source***We would return to this place again !
target***The processor a AMD Semprom at 21 ghz is a bummer it does not have the power for HD or heavy computing .
source***The staff ignored my friends and I the entire time we were there .
source***The kitchen however , is almost always slow .
source***This was a repeat visit and we 'll definitely be back again .
target***The lcd screen stopped working on mine after 10 months .
target***Whenever I call Dell about an unrelated problem , they ask me if my laptop is running slowly and if I 'd like to purchase more memory for $ 75 .
target***This is my first computer purchase
source***While the place is not a hotspot hangout , the drinks are unique and pack a lot of bang for the buck .
target***What a great little laptop .
source***We were seated outside and the waiter spilled red wine and hot tea on myself and my date .
target***The computer runs extremely slowly , whether opening Word or My Computer .
target***Returned laptop for repair a 2nd time and it came back with obvious physical damage keyboard bulging and speaker grill pressed in , buttons not working and USB ports inoperative .
target***It is very well built .
target***So it was only about 2 weeks ago .
target***Would like more trendy , high tech features .
source***From the complimentary chef app of a delicate butternut squash ravioli in a delicious truffle sauce to an amazing buttery and tender langostine entree to a dessert that I ca n't remember because of the fabulous Cakebread Cabernet we were drinking - the whole evening was amazing .
source***I have been to Rao 's probably 15 times the past 3 years and it keeps getting better .
target***I was happy with My purchase of a Toshiba Satellite L305D - S5934 laptop until it came time to have it repaired under the Toshiba Warranty .
source***Do not get the Go Go Hamburgers , no matter what the reviews say .
source***THE BEST PLACE TO BRING KIDS OR ANY FRIENDS WHO WANT TO DO SOMETHING DIFFERENT .
target***Vista is a nightmare .
source***Hats off to the chef .
target***Yes , I thought the expese was a little much , but I now realize you get what you pay for .
target***But if you 're willing to pay another 200 dollar for a windows disc .
source***While the menu is n't especially groundbreaking , everything I ' ve tried so far has been well - executed and tasty .
target***Recently there are a few incidents that annoy the hell out of me .
source***A narrow corridor leads to a tiny space where there are three tiny white tiled counters , a great deal of mess stacks of bottles , cans and a small counter holding 12 - 14 entrees .
source***The food is mostly made from scratch , fresh and well prepared .
source***Whether it 's the parmesean porcini souffle or the lamb glazed with balsamic vinegar , you will surely be transported to Northern Italy with one bite .
target***I bought my Acer Aspire custom made in June 2008 .
source***I wo n't go back unless someone else is footing the bill .
source***Bagels are ok , but be sure not to make any special requests !
target***Once open , the leading edge is razor sharp .
source***Guacamole+shrimp appetizer was really great , we both had the filet , very good , did n't much like the frites that came with , but the filet was so good , neither of us cared .
source***Compared to other shabu restaurants around town , this places wins hands - down .
target***The track pad to me is what really stands out though , you can do several different things with it just depending on how many fingers you use on the track pad , awesome thinking Apple !
target***It was old but it was not till we bought the Dell did we realize how great it was .
source***The service was terrible , we had to wait for everything and ask several of different people for the same thing before we were allowed to be served .
target***There is a little indent to help open it , but good luck with that .
target***Just keep in mind the graphics is not dedicated so loading the movie almost took a minute , but it ran fairly smooth for a non - dedicated graphics card .
source***The decor is very simple but comfortable .
target***My son and his family have a hard time financially because he is self - employed so the family had no computer of any kind , and kyle the oldest child is 12 and really need something to help him in school .
target***sounds like a typewriter , but if you can get past that , this is a great laptop for a little money !
target***If you do n't like fingerprints , this might not be the laptop for you .
target***the manufacturer 's warranty only covers replacement / repair of parts .
source***This is the perfect date spot for Williamsburg couples .
source***Amma is nothing special .
target***Dell 's customer disservice is an insult to it 's customers who pay good money for shoddy products .
source***The prices are exceptionally reasonable for food of this caliber .
source***Joya used to be a cool spot with decent food and a colorful , if not relaxed , atmosphere .
source***Unlike HH up the block , this place actually gives you hearty and hot bagels this town is known for .
target***No temporary replacement , they are out of replacements because many computers had problems with the Nvidia chipset status of repair .
target***Sure , the initial out of pocket expense is greater , but that should not dissuade anyone from the fact that these machines run like none other on the planet , and when I factor in all the money in that I wasted on Geek Squad and the latest patches to de - corrupt my infested PCs , it probably comes out about even anyhow .
target***I also purchased Office Max 's " Max Assurance " with the no lemon clause .
source***We ' ve lived in the area for more than 8 years .
source***If you want good authentic Thai this place is not the place to go .
target***So , the hard disk capacity really does n't matter to me .
source***Owner must have coem on this website to give himself credit .
target***The ATI graphics card is a huge plus , definitely a good value if you need to be able to run some slightly older games that a Intel built - in card would have trouble with , such as Half - Life 2 or even World of Warcraft .
target***THis computer may be small but it is one heck of a power horse .
source***I am completely hooked on this place , it is ridiculous .
target***They offer the best warranty in the business , and do n't 3rd party it out like Toshiba .
source***I will recommend Scopa to all of my friends for a place to go for wonderful Italian food .
source***Got club soda , filled with ice , no lime .
target***The only thing I do n't understand is that the resolution of the screen is n't high enough for some pages , such as Yahoo ! Mail .
source***My husband and I have been there a couple of times and each time we sat at the sushi bar chef Yoshi and ordered everything ala carte .
source***We ate out in the back patio , which is worth it as it 's cool and the music is hear well there .
target***1st time they got it working the next 5 month they had me send it in .
source***Butter was melted , white wine warm , cheese oozing everywhere .
target***My Toshiba did not have sound on everything , just certain things .
target***I would not recommend this to anyone wanting a notebook expecting the performance of a Desktop it does not meet the expectations .
source***What a great place !
source***The pizza was really good .
source***I can not imagine a friendlier staff working in a restaurant .
target***It 's the inside that is truly wonderful .
source***This is the best sushi in new york city , hands down .
target***With all the goodies inside this machine , it is a value .
target***So , after Apple replaced the hard drive I enjoyed another 4 months of my new computer , until it froze this morning -- completely .
target***It would be a load on long trips where a lot of walking is required .
target***My parents bought it for me as a graduation gift , and i ' m totally almost kind of maybe definitely obsessed with it .
target***This computer was bought because I wanted top of the line , fast , reliable , HA .
target***I have had two Toshiba satellite computers and while they are okay , they are in no way comparable to the Mac .
source***One less manhattanite the better .
source***I ordered tamarind duck and my wife ordered noodles with ground beef , and we were both delighted by the way the dishes evoked Thai flavors in unexpected ways .
target***Then just the other day , my left " mouse " button snapped !
target***It does n't heat up like my old laptop .
target***I never had this kind of quality issue with Dell not to say Dell is that great , not with a brand new laptop .
source***food was delivered by a busboy , not waiter We got no cheese offered for the pasta , our water and wine glasses remained EMPTY our entire meal , when we would have easily spent another $ 20 on wine .
source***I complete the total bagel experience by having it lightly toasted .
target***I ca n't begin to say how disappointed I am .
source***SO SO SO SO SO good !
source***Raga 's is a romantic , cozy restaurant .
target***The battery life has not decreased since I bought it , so i ' m thrilled with that .
target***I feel that it was poorly put together , because once in a while different plastic pieces would come off of it .
source***The fish was not fresh and the rice tasted old and stale .
target***I do n't have stupid pop up windows even when I have pop ups blocked , I do n't have to wait 5 minutes for a webpage to download , and best of all I can run all the web programming software I need to use all at once without slowing me down .
target***While there are occasions that my computer will freeze or will need to be manually shut down , this occurs far less frequently than on PC computers and laptops that I ' ve used .
target***Not enough time for me to give it 5 stars !
target***-Complied to their protocol , called number , made case , got an email address to send complaint .
source***I come from a family of pizzeria owners , and I ' m almost ashamed to say that the pizza in Fornino 's blows my families receipies away .
target***Nightly my computer defrags itself and runs a virus scan .
source***The staff is very kind and well trained , they 're fast , they are always prompt to jump behind the bar and fix drinks , they know details of every item in the menu and make excelent recomendations .
source***I do n't know who they think they are but they have no respect for the residents of the neighborhood ever since they opened their cabaret next door and blasts loud music till three in the morning every weekend during the summer .
target***with the switch being at the top you need to memorize the key combination rather than just flicking a switch .
source***The atmosphere is noisy and the waiters are literally walking around doing things as fast as they can .
source***The best part of the experience was knowing that the manager a bubbly , friendly young woman with a great smile truly cared about how we were doing .
source***What is even better , is that the prices are very affordable as well , and the food is really good .
source***This place has the the correct ambience and an excellent staff to make you feel like a guest and a friend at the same time .
source***Complimentary stuff kept coming , and when the waiter saw me opening a gift , I received my dessert on a plate that had Happy Birthday written on it , with a candlevery nice touch , and attentive staff .
source***The bagels are also reasonably priced for NYC .
source***We actually gave 10 % tip which we have never done despite mediocre food and service , because we felt totally ripped off .
source***This place is worth an one - hour drive .
source***This is the pinnacle of Indian Fast Food all fast foods in my opinion .
source***Having hunted around for a quiet , romantic , yet not hideously expensive restaurant I stumbled across reviews for La Lanterna and gave it a shot .
target***I know that everyone thinks Macs are overpriced and overrated , but once you get past the initial expense you 'll find that they 're worth every penny besides , there 's always the financing plan that Best Buy offers .
source***Another great place to take out - of - towners !
target***I ' ve only had mine a day but I ' m already used to it .
target***i love to use it it is esay and light .
source***You must have the crabmeat lasagna which is out of this world and the chocolate bread pudding for dessert .
source***I recommend getting a reservation even though we saw people seated without one .
target***The gray color was a good choice .
source***The quail was fantastic and unique and the pastas were full of flavor .
source***Decent Thai food in cute , though a bit dank , little Nolita hangout , BUT service terrible .
source***I was at Rao 's last We d .
target***I love this program , it is superior to windows movie maker .
source***I had the Pad Thai and the noodles were sticky .
source***I also order for delivery and the restaurant forgot half the order .
target***I just took the broken cords into the Apple store and they gave me new ones .
source***While there are plenty of places to go for a good corned beef sandwich , Katz 's has a charm about it .
target***Great value , fast delivery Computer works as if brand new , no problems , very pleased
source***bottles of wine are cheap and good .
target***This laptop is a great price and has a sleek look .
source***And Kruno , the beverage manager is the best bartender I have yet to come across .
source***Nice restaurant overall , with classic upscale Italian decor .
target***Satisfy what I paid for it .
target***I will NEVER buy Refurbished again , I do n't cae how cheap it is .
source***Knowledge of the chef and the waitress are below average .
source***Its location is good and the fact that Hutner College is near and their prices are very reasonable , makes students go back to Suan again and again .
target***Seems like maybe a bad shipment from Toshiba .
target***The difference is phenomenal .
target***The Macbook starts fast , does n't crash , has a fantastic display , is small and light I have the 133 model , and is n't always complaining about updates , lost connections , errors , blue screens , etc .
source***not only does make the best pizza in NY , maybe anywhere .
target***It is , however , very heavy .
source***My co - workers had to wait almost an hour for delivery , only to discover that what they got was not what they ordered .
source***On a recent Saturday night , I was with a group of 5 at the Bread Bar .
source***Great pizza and fantastic service .
source***I must give it Yon out of Yon stars !
target***I have had a Mac for 6 years and wo n't go back to PC .
target***They really do have the worlds very worst repair service .
target***BAck she goes !
source***It appears to be the owner 's first venture and it shows .
source***Dakshin is one of the few affordable and tasty Indian restaurant in the upper east side .
target***At first , the computer seemed a great deal -- seemingly high - end specs for a low , low price .
source***A great choice at any cost and a great deal .
target***With what I paid for this computer it should have had everything on it .
source***The food is spectacular , from the appitizers to the main course , and then of course the desserts , WOW you 'll need no more .
source***Right off the major deegan you get ladies from all over the city .
target***iTunes is a handy music - management program , and it is essential for anyone with an iPod .
source***Service is not exactly five star , but that s not really a big deal .
source***What an amazing meal and experience !
target***The capabilities using that program alone made me want a Mac .
source***They charge $ 600 for rice .
target***Again .
target***Very dissappointed becase I have had toshibas for years , and never a issue .
source***Just stick with the small dishes !
target***Received all four in good order ;
source***And I say snacking because it really is not set up to be a proper dinner .
source***I ' ve been here 3 times for lunch and it is one of my favorites in the city .
target***bought notebook 07/2009 .
source***I have taken practically every guest that has come to visit me in NY and hooked a few New Yorkers onto Peep as well .
source***Everyone was more then happy with his choices .
source***This is the only Thai place I go too in NYC , it 's wonderful , and live relaxed Jazz on certain nights .
source***We left after one drink .
target***It all just makes sense .
source***You could get a much better dining experience for the same amount of money in a lot of other French Bistros .
source***On a hot day it was fabulous to stop in and enjoy lunch .
source***It seems like this is a place the locals like and the people working here liked it too .
target***Toshiba is aware of the issue but unless the extended warrenty is bought Toshiba will do nothing about it .
target***the whole experiece is horrible so save up and buy a better laptop .
target***I do not know for sure .
target***No , tey do n't even support their own bios and it could be a problem with the bios How can a company that makes a fairly decent product get away with such insanity ? ? ! !
target***So not having my laptop was discouraging .
source***This place is a great stop for great food .
target***That day !
target***The apple systems are over priced luxurys that ar n't worth what they are being charged for , this model 's specifications are far from being impressive and they only thing you get out of this is the apple name .
target***I especially appreciate the fact that it has almost zero viruses and spyware problems !
source***Okay , so I never write but there does n't seem to fair balance of positive to negative reviews concerning Green Bo and it 's time to speak up , I live in Chinatown .
source***fine dining restaurant quality .
target***See when it comes to laptops you buy it and get just a normal operating system with trials of must need stuff that should come with it .
source***Better than the bagel shop on the corner , but not worth going out of your way for , in my opinion .
source***But for whatever reason , prices are about twice as high .
target***The computer first started malfunctioning 3 months after purchasing it .
source***Avoid at all costs .
target***In desparation , I called their Customer Service number and was told that my warranty had expired 2 days old and that the priviledge of talking to a technician would cost me have your credit card ready .
source***So , again , give it a try .
source***The dim sum however was very good .
source***Would NEVER go back there .
source***I ' ve never been treated so rudely .
source***Terrific menu full of unique rolls and special dishes .
target***Then , within 5 months , the charger crapped out on me .
source***There are other Vietnamese restaurants in the chinatown area and you can forget about those .
target***Laptop is to be used like a Netbook .
target***Needless to say , not to happy with the product .
source***The food has been consistant for years and it never lets you down .
target***Second HDD cover has walls inside that need to be broken if you what to install one .
target***Bigger HD , better graphics card , and a bid HD .
source***The ambience was nice , but service was n't so great .
target***The Awesomest of the awesomest .
source***I went to DF for Valentines Day dinner .
source***All in all , this midtown gem instantly became one of my favorite sushi restaurants in the city .
target***The online tutorial videos make it super easy to learn if you have always used a PC .
source***I ' ve waited over one hour for food .
source***The food 's dazzling flavors overwhelm the palate , truly embracing the beauty of authentic Thai cuisine .
target***When I finally had everything running with all my software installed I plugged in my droid to recharge and the system crashed .
source***Arigato Gozimas Yuka !
target***It does nt overheat or make any loud noises .
source***My wife and I ate here earlier this week and have not stopped ranting and raving about the food .
target***I ' ve always owned a PC and decided to try a MacBook to see what it 's all about .
source***I had Lobster Bisque it has 2 oz of Maine Lobster in it .
source***Overall , worht every penny .
target***great battery life .
target***It works fine with our wireless and they ' ve had not problems .
target***2nd Mac book I have purchased from MacConnection .
source***This place , however , has a lot less pretension than Joya and the Thai food is still above - average .
target***Its a good laptop for its value .
source***If it 's just a quick martini at the bar which I recommend Jeffery 's or a mind blowing Roast Chicken , go to Village !
target***What a waste .
source***They even scoop it out nice for those on a diet not too much not to little .
target***So far , a great product .
source***For myself and family we would only go here to celebrate an occassion , I do prefer smaller , quiter restaurants .
source***They are FAST .
target***The computer was two weeks late in delivery because HP forgot to complete the required import paperwork .
source***However , for what we spent , overall , it just was not up to par .
source***While the food was excellent , it was n't cheap though not extremely expensive either .
target***I could not handle it one hand like I can the replacement computer I purchased .
source***The waitresses are nice -- also you can just get counter service sit .
source***Try it side by side and there 's no comparison .
target***In early May I got it back and this time I only had it back for 1 day before it had a NEW issue so it was sent back in for the 6th time they expedited the repairs so I was only supposed to have to be without it for 3 days and it was supposed to be fixed , by a Senior Tech .
target***Do not purchase this laptop .
source***Yes , they use fancy ingredients , but even fancy ingredients do n't make for good pizza unless someone knows how to get the crust right .
source***try the spicy shrimp appetizer again , not the greatest value in the world but worth the price and the lamb vindaloo is great .
target***Treat yourself to a more expensive , long - lasting laptop of quality like a Sony , Apple , or Toshiba .
target***It turned out it 's not really a problem to have a Mac .
target***Hieroglyphics are quite common .
target***I investigated netbooks and saw the Toshiba NB305-N410BL .
target***The Toshiba Net book operates very well .
target***Best thing is I can use existing 32 bit old programs .
target***Disappointing for such a lovely screen and at a reasonable price
source***When going out for a nice dinner , I like a nice ambiance as well as very good food .
target***I ' m very happy with this machine !
target***There is hardly any memory on the computer 's hard drive .
source***So , for good food i 'd recommend it , but not for a fun night out .
source***But they do n't have a toaster , which is strange .
target***We did n't because it was already over 2,400 dollars !
target***it 's just a great toy to have around .
target***Each time taking about 1 day or so .
target***I dislike the weight and size , cubersome .
target***Because he said that the hinge is under the motherboard and they have to dismantle the whole thing before it can be tightened .
target***Really like the textured surface which shows no fingerprints .
source***The crispy chicken was n't for us , though .
target***So far , so good !
source***I ' m still mad that i had to pay for lousy food .
target***I needed a new computer for graduate school had never owned a laptop before , and the only reason I did n't purchase a Mac was because my school 's website strongly recommended students purchase PCs .
target***Comes with iMovie ;
target***DEFINITELY recommended ! ! !
source***Scalina Fedeli reminded me why service is so integral to fine dining .
target***It is sleek , smooth , and lightweight .
target***The neat and organized icon list is a welcome change from cluttered and confusing desktop icons .
source***I would highly recommand requesting a table by the window .
source***Everything looks great , the drinks , the decor , the food , even the people .
source***Other guests enjoyed pizza , santa fe chopped salad and fish and chips .
source***Compared to Ess - a , Tal offers a less doughy bagel !
source***Read all the other review , they 'll confirm it .
source***Service was very good and warm .
target***The Macbook is a fantastic laptop .
source***The pickles were great addition .
source***Very neighborhoody , very quick and sufficient .
source***Gigino 's in Wagner Park is so enjoyable .
target***The Computer itself is a good product but the repair depot stinks .
source***They came out over cooked and the cheese was almost non existant .
source***Nice find .
target***If I have a problem with any of my apple items I make an appointment at one of my local stores and they work on correcting it right there .
source***Warm and friendly in the winter and terrific outdoor seating in the warmer months .
target***The latest is on my LG Netbook X12
source***I thought I had died and gone to heaven .
target***No machine has come remotely close to causing as many problems .
source***What generous portions !
source***We had the scallops as an appetizer and they were delicious and the sauce was wonderful .
target***Also the display is exceptional !
source***We had a party in their private room and they made it truly memorable and were very helpful in the planning .
source***Pastrami or corned beef are juicy and piled high ask for extra rye bread .
source***The sandwiches are dry , tasteless and way overpriced .
target***So having the AC plug go out on me and get lose or I could actually here it inside my computer on two of the three times is not good .
target***I custom ordered the machine from HP and could NOT understand the techie due to his accent .
target***Drivers updated ok but the BIOS update froze the system up and the computer shut down .
target***My battery went bad about a year and a half after having it and it cost around eighty to a hundred dollars !
target***and then , a guy came out to serve me instead .
source***I wish they would change back to what it was before .
target***Needs Power and Mouse Cable to Plug in back instead of side , In the way of operating a mouse in small area .
source***I plan on stopping by next week as well .
source***The fish is fresh but the variety of fish is nothing out of ordinary .
target***The bottom - line is that this laptop just is n't worth it .
source***We had the lobster sandwich and it was FANTASTIC .
source***The food is good , but very expensive for the casualness of it .
source***No gimmicks here - the food speaks for itself in its freshness and preparation .
source***They have some great entrees here as well .
target***Unfortunately , that is not the case .
target***The 13 Macbook Pro just fits in my budget and with free shipping and no tax to CA this is the best price we can get for a great product .
target***Let me tell you , this machine is great .
source***While it 's not Nobu , it sure is a great deal and you definitely will leave feeling satisfied and full .
target***The price is great for this model , I only plan on using it for media in the entertainment room .
source***I 'd call it an italian dinner ' .
target***I ve had to call tech support many times .
source***The food was very expensive we spent $ 160 for lunch for two but extremely tasty .
source***To give you an idea of how good we thought it was , we ended up going to Ping 's three weekends in a row ! ! !
source***I ' ve had the chicken with garlic sauce , chicken with black bean sauce , and hunan chicken .
target***10 plus hours of battery .
target***Although I opted for the lowest end MacBook Pro , this thing holds its own .
target***After the warrenty expired the hard drive went bad and it would have cost more to fix then to replace .
target***They say sorry out of warranty .
source***My only problem is that you are literally sitting on top of the people next to you !
target***Honestly , I spent more time waiting for it to unfreeze then actually doing what I got on there for !
source***Well , this place is so Ghetto its not even funny .
target***This computer is exceptionally thin for it 's screen size and processing power .
target***I am not going to sit here and complain about it not having a cd drive and what not because it is a netbook , it is made to be compact and if you want all the other stuff get a laptop .
source***Its located in greenewich village .
target***the mouse pad and buttons are the worst i ' ve ever seen .
source***I got enough reasons to keep coming back ! ! !
source***If you venture off the island of Manhattan and ca n't seem to find a great Italian restaurant , drive to Corona .
target***I would buy one of these for every person in my office if I could .
source***The dish had like 6 pieces of beef in it .
source***Do n't waste your time , or money ! !
target***Everything from the design to the OS is simple and to the point .
source***Will not be back .
target***But the machine is awesome and iLife is great and I love Snow Leopard X .
target***I also did not like the loud noises it made or how the bottom of the computer would get really hot .
target***After replacing the hard drive the battery stopped working 3 months of use which was frustrating .
target***The newer MacBook that I have purchased is one of the best computers .
source***Great friendly service , Fast seating , Fast Delivery , Excellent sushi .
source***I have eaten at Shabu Tatsu at least 5 times and I always want to go back for more !
target***The Macbook is also made better , my computer has never got a virus , and the laptop runs just as fast as the first day I bought it .
target***previous laptops were pc 's , still have them , but the mac osx is a clean and smooth operating system .
source***Loved it !
target***It is easy to use , good quality and good price .
source***GO HERE .
target***You ca n't even get a satellite card which is why I bought to begin with .
source***The food was not very tasty , the portioins were tiny even for such a high quality restaurant .
source***well , i did n't find it there , and trust , i have told everyone i can think of about my experience .

source***Veal Parmigana , Better than Patsy 's !
source***You can barely see who you are with never mind have a conversation .

target***They would repair one thing , send it back and it would still have the same problem .
target***Also the speakers are not very loud , But it is a netbook .
source***Top spot in town for Vietnamese classics , better than places that cost a lot more .
target***I love the easy to see screen , and It works well for work , persoal or just play .
source***Note that they do not serve beer , you must bring your own .
target***The computer did what it was NOT supposed to do , and I did n't know what to do .
source***I could n't reccommend their Godmother pizza any higher .
source***We live in New Jersey and whenever we go into New York City we buy bagels to eat hot and then to freeze they told me that if I call in the order , they 'd bring it out to the car so I would n't have to look for parking .
source***Do n't eat here unless you 're starving for thai food and you work next door .

target***little short on RAM but you get what you pay for .
target***In the shop , these MacBooks are encased in a soft rubber enclosure , so you will never know about the razor edge until you buy it , get it home , break the seal and use it very clever con .

target***Hope this helps !
source***I will definetly be going back .
source***yourself a favor and have dinner here and see if you do n't agree with me .
source***Not too crazy about their sake martini .
source***In reality to maximize potential diners they were still taking phone reservations and reallocating tables of those waiting in the lobby .
target***I ' ve been impressed with the battery life and the performance for such a small amount of memory .
source***I am not the most experienced person when it comes to Thai food , but my friend who took me there is .
target***After the first few months , the computer started crashing about every week .
source***Our waiter and all of the people helping him were attentive and genuine .
target***It turns out that this hp pc had been preciously sold by Wal Mart .
source***The service is awful .
target***Page just disapeared after you got yahoo or downloaded something .
source***Go with a group of friends and you will have a great time .
target***-I propose that they can just swap the hard drives .
source***Lived in Shanghai most of my life and thought the food was comparable to the flagship Green Bo restaurant there .
source***Yes you have to wait to be seat and because its small there is no waiting area and the seat at the bar was all taken .
source***Good drink .
target***First of all , I ' ve been Dell fan for more than fifteen years .
target***The video card is great for media , and above average for gaming , but not a gamers first choice .
source***Authentic food and they have REAL service , not just the rush you get sometimes when they try to push you out the door .
target***Finally after months of research the discovered that they mailed it to a Walmart and there probably would be no way to find the box .
target***I have a lapdesk which I can use , but I can still feel the heat through the foam and plastic .
target***I love this computer .
target***The minute you fire it up it 's all good , very easy user interface .
target***For example , when my husband turns the light out while I ' m on the computer .
source***Service is great , takeout is good too .
source***I really loved the different and inovated touch that 's the cheff gives to the food .
source***The wait staff is pleasant , fun , and for the most part gorgeous in the wonderful aesthetic beautification way , not in that she's - way - cuter - than - me - that - b @ # $ * way .
target***Being a PC user my whole life , it 's taking a bit of time to adapt to the OS of a Mac but I ' m finding my way around .
target***I still see the benefits of a PC when I do not know how to do something on my mac .
source***Fantastic place .
source***The only problem is that the manager is a complete incompetent .
target***then on top of it all their cusromer service center is in the middle east .
target***keys are all in weird places and is way too large for the way it is designed .
target***It 's not a wear - and - tear issue , not due to user carelessness and most importantly , they CA N'T guarantee the problem will be solved if it is sent for service and I have to accept the outcome .
target***Also , I have alot of trouble with it getting very hot , and not even sitting on anything to make it hot .
source***A Thai restaurant out of rice during dinner ?
target***The battery life is amazingly long at 7hrs and 5hrs if you use it .
target***I do not recommend this company or their products ! ! ! !
target***The Apple will run Internet Explorer , but at an amazingly slow rate .
target***I ' m Very disappointed in Dell .
source***Still , any quibbles about the bill were off - set by the pour - your - own measures of liquers which were courtesey of the house .
source***Everything we had was pretty good , but we have only been there once .
target***This process continued to repeat itself until the mother board had been replaced 4 times and the hard drive replaced 3 times .
target***Have had many higher priced computers crash and burn long before ever got to use all that great memory and speed , etc .
target***What a mistake !
source***Amma has the worst value for money I have experienced in NYC over the past 2 years .
source***They forgot a sandwich , did n't include plastic forks , and did n't include pita with the hummus platter .
target***But then , something goes wrong .
source***I LOVE their Thai noodles with shrimp and chicken and coconut juice is the MUST !
source***The servers give you some sample slices of your order while you wait shortly I might add .
target***I will be patient for few months .

target***Amazing Quality !
source***So rushing us out was absolutely unnecessary !
target***ASUS said my net - book was working properly .
source***The staff makes you feel at home , the food is great and the atmosphere is WONDERFUL !
target***Processor , When compared to my 3 week old Early 2011 edition there I barely experience any difference in performance 23 GHz v / s 24 GHz .

source***Not only was the food outstanding , but the little perks were great .
source***The food was pretty tradional but it was hot and good with large portions .
source***the best I ' ve found outside of the Chinatown masters .
target***I was given a Mac as a birthday present and could n't be happier with it 3 years later .

target***Where you click and hold and drag it picture , link , etc to where you want it .
source***My family and I ate here last night for our annual Christmas dinner with the family members who would rather spend the holidays with friends out - of - town .
source***This is a great place to take out - of - towners , and perfect for watching the sunset .
target***It is SO much fun to play with .
source***Example is the soup which was about 6 oz for $ 12 dollars and the mushrooms where $ 12 for about 1 oz .
target***The buttons you have to press a little harder than most .
target***It meets all my needs for work and pleasure while traveling .
target***PLEASE MAKE THESE !
target***Keyboard could use some trimming .
target***The screen is very large and crystal clear with amazing colors and resolution .
source***We were seated promptly as we had reservations , however after that the service was slow .
target***Do you ever think HP would do that ? NEVER !
target***3 Horrible customer support
target***Excellent speed for processing data .
source***Everything at Sala Thai is tasty and well - portioned .
target***I ' ve also had to have the keyboard replaced at my expense .
source***David , Daytona Beach , FL
source***It is expensive but well worth the money .
source***Yeah , it 's that good .
source***It was not above ordinary and the beef version had cheap undercooked beef .
target***The battery life , before the battery completely died of course , left much to be desired .
target***Apple is always great about the aesthetics of things , they always come up with good looking products .
target***Yes , I have it on the highest available setting .
target***The built in camera is very useful when chatting with other techs in remote buildings on our campus .
source***I was really disappointed ant wanted to tell everyone not to go eat or even take out food from there .
target***I went from BestBuy to Dell , Windows to Apple .
target***The only downfall is the battery only last 15 - 20 hrs when not plugged in .
target***Now , I guess , I 'll have to unload my M6809 on some poor , hapless soul .
target***Another two weeks later and it was back in my possession .
source***I ' ve never felt more unwelcome than last month at Jimmy 's Bronx Cafe .
target***It seemed to be a very nice laptop except I was not able to load my Garmin GPS software or Microsoft Office 2003 .
target***Now I know !
target***Even though the computer is larger they did not make the keyboard larger .
source***The lox is always fresh too .
source***If you like the food and the value you get from some of Chinatown restaurants , this is not the place for you .
source***We were in search of food and stumbled on this block of Indian restaurants on East Sixth Street .
source***Average to good Thai food , but terrible delivery .
target***> iPhoto is probably the best program I have ever worked with , easy and convenient .

target***I would recommend anyone to buy from pcconnection express .
target***I am sorry that I purchased this laptop .

target***I need graphic power to run my Adobe Creative apps efficiently .
source***Looking around , I saw a room full of New Yorkers enjoying a real meal in a real restaurant , not a clubhouse of the fabulous trying to be seen .
target***They claim call center is still down .
target***I have never really been big on downloading anything so I was n't too worried about getting a virus , plus I thought I was protected by Norton .
target***But let me tell you , the mac book pro is so professional .
target***I was starting to boil .
target***If you 're looking for something to fly through those massive spreadsheets or play a graphics - intensive game , you 'd be better off getting a machine aimed at that segment of the market .
source***But after last night , Spice Grill is the only place I ' m eating indian cuisine .
source***This is n't your corner Chinese food takeout .
source***Searching to get out from the cold , freezing weather , we went into what we thought was a deli .
target***I 'll stick to Tashiba .

target***The problems started with just the screen freezing .
source***Worth a visit .
target***And , if you are going to deal with HP be careful .

source***We were not dissappointed in the least bit by this little gem .
source***I will never visit this restaurant again .
source***The place is a lot of fun .
target***Battery life could be better but overall for the price and Toshiba 's reputation for laptops it 's great !

source***Has the chef and owner changed ? ? ?
target***I love my Apple , it is quick and easy to use .
source***After reading the posts , I was always skeptical to go to The Minnow , despite living in Park Slope .
source***The people with carts of food do n't understand you because they do n't speak English , their job is to give you the delicious food you point at .
target***The latest and mightiest Macbook pro 17-inch was bought by my university on the 30th of June 2009 .
source***For years , I thought Tuscan cuisine was the best , but Salvatore converted me to the hearty Neapolitan fare on my first visit .
target***It is fast booting up , shutting down , and connection with the internet .
source***We went here for lunch a couple of weeks ago on a Saturday , and I was thoroughly impressed with the food .
source***Service is average .
source***Plain and simple it 's bad thai food .
target***I bought this laptop on Saturday and am completely in love with it !
target***Stay away from HP .
source***The staff is accomodating , the ambiance is exciting and yet relaxed , and the food is out of this world !
target***So do n't get it .
target***Then I proceed to tell her that I checked out other retail stores that carry the netbook and it was n't LIKE THAT .
source***You order from a menu , so you leave feeling like you missed the full experience .
target***I purchased this laptop 9 months ago !
target***This is not Best Buy 's fault .
target***The large screen also helps when you are working in design based programs like Adobe Creative Suite .
target***Garageband is easy to work with , like all the other apple applications I ' ve had experience with .

source***The Halibut was too salty , dessert was so so do n't waste any of your calories and service was poor .

source***The steak is good , the fish is good and the sushi was surprisingly great .
source***The service was ok .
target***But we had paid for bluetooth , and there was none .
source***Will have to return to try the chocolate !
source***They 're rude at times , and not very friendly .

target***I never have had a good result with this computer .
target***The PhotoBooth is a great program , it takes very good pictures with the built - in camera .
source***But WARNING , to all those that use this site be weary , be very weary of recommendations .

target***Either way the entire thing was just a joke , a complete rip off !
source***I ate clams oreganta and spectacular salad with perfectly marinated cucumbers and tomatoes with lots of shrimp and basil .
source***It 's somewhere you can eat and be happy .
source***Their pad penang is delicious and everything else is fantastic .
target***I decided to get this pile of crap on a whim and totally freaking regret it .
source***Whenever you need a Sushi fix , Mizu will be there with quality fish and great service .

target***The pictures are clear as can be .
target***They click .
source***enough said !
target***The 4 USB ports are nice , but the two on the side only work now and then .
target***I got it for Christmas , and I was so excited to set it up !
source***THe perfect spot .
source***The exotic food is beautifully presented and is a delight in delicious combinations .
target***Small enough to use on a long flight , Light enough to carry through airports and powerful enough to replace my desktop while on long business trips .
source***Good for dates or with friends .
source***Kosher dills are the perfect compliment for your unforgetable sandwich and they give you plenty of them .
target***This mac is great !
source***Look elsewhere .
target***At first when I got this product , I loved it .
target***The newer black keyboard took a little bit away from the previous gray one which looked really slick , but it is still a great notebook !
source***My fish was delicious in an incredible curry sauce .
source***We recently decided to try this location , and to our delight , they have outdoor seating , perfect since I had my yorkie with me .

target***I love its solid build , light wt and excellent battery life for now .

source***This is by far my favorite place in the neighborhood .
target***The feature are good enough for what I need .
source***Over time , the food quality has decreased substantially , it is a lot less crowded than it used to , and the service must definitely be part of the reason .
target***I love the keyboard .
source***The staff is incredibly helpful and attentive .
source***Other apetizers and food
target***I gave it to my daughter because I just hated the screen , hated that it had no cd drive to at least play cd 's when I wanted to listen to music and do schoolwork .

source***It melted in my little mouth and the perfect consistency - not too fishy , creamy , and slightly buttery .
target***EITHER THE COMPUTER IS TOO SLOW TO DETECT THE KEYS TYPED THIS IS UNLIKELY AS I AM A SLOW TYPIST OR THE KEYBOARD SIMPLY DOES NOT DETECT THE KEYS BEING TYPED .

source***We had a great time at the Jekyll and hyde Pub last night .
target***I think this computer is super lame .

target***It lasted for many years of travel , kids and abuse and if I fired it up today , it would work .
source***The noodle and rices dishes taste great .
source***The menu is Prix Fixe , so be prepared to spend at least $ 60 per person , but it is Well worth itsuperb food .

target***After they found no other way , they told me to courier it to themsince they do n't allow the use of the post office at my expense , and sent me a 4 page list of very specific packaging instructions to follow or it would n't be covered .
source***It can be a very fun experience with a group , and kids 6 and over would love it .
source***The only thing I moderately enjoyed was their Grilled Chicken special with Edamame Puree .
target***the only fact i do n't like about apples is they generally use safari and i do n't use safari but after i install Mozzilla firfox i love every single bit about it .

target***this is my second one and the same problem , bad video card unreliable overall , this will be my second time returning this laptop back to best buy .
target***Probbly the worst decision we ever made !
target***It has everything you need to get the job done .
target***Problem fixed which is great but there went another two weeks without my laptop at school .
target***I paid about 18000 for this laptop because of all the bells and whistles and it kept crapping out on me .
target***It is speedy when connected wirelessly to any network regardless if the connection is weak or not .
target***This thing is a lemon .
source***This is the BEST Shabu - Shabu Restaurant in the Try - State Area .
target***Again in February my computer completely failed to the point that it could not load Windows so I contacted Acer to get it fixed thru my Warrenty and it took about 3 days fighting on the phone with agents and it seemed as though NONE of them spoke English .
target***The MacBook is way too overpriced for something so simple and chaotic .
target***I have had some excellent computer and have found I had no idea what to do with them
source***I would recommend this place to anyone and would without a doubt come again .
source***No free drink .
source***Their sushi , Kamikaze and other Rolls are fresh and well presented .
source***My friend 's food was also the complete opposite of what it 's supposed to taste like aND look like .
source***The pizza is the best if you like thin crusted pizza .
source***Great roofdeck , nice group of 30 somethings , but no music , kind of quiet .
target***Summary , HP knew they were shipping out bad BIOS and did nothing proactive to resolve it .
source***sometimes i get bad food and bad service , sometimes i get good good and bad service .
source***Will go back but only sate those homesick stomach cravings !
target***the laptop was really good and it goes really fast just the way i thought it would of run .
target***Good keyboard , long battery life , largest hard drive and windows 7 .
target***So i would not reccomend anyone buying this computer
target***A coupla months later , they change my hard drive .
target***Support has been lackluster and now I just want a refund .
source***The food arrived 20 minutes after I called , cold and soggy .
target***How Toshiba handles the repair seems to vary , some folks indicate that they were charged for even an intial fix , others had the repair done 5 times .
source***Excellent lunch buffet for only $ 695 .
target***Just a month and a half or two months ago , my VAIO crashed again .
target***I ' ve saved a lot of time and headaches so far , using my new MacBook Pro .
source***Save your money and do n't waste your calories , go to Margharita 's on Washington Street instead , they have amazing food and the BEST service .
source***get over it !
source***Do n't judge this place prima facie , you have to try it to believe it , a home away from home for the literate heart .
target***while about 8 years ago , I hope that the quality has changed .
source***I am reluctant to write because I would not want my jem of a pizza place to become overcrowded .
target***So I called , AGAIN .
target***The Toshiba laptop was a great purchase .
source***The whole set up is truly unprofessional and I wish Cafe Noir would get some good staff , because despite the current one this is a great place .
source***Prices too high for this cramped and unappealing resturant .
target***Awesome laptop and the perfect size to carry around in college .
source***They did not have mayonnaise , forgot our toast , left out ingredients ie cheese in an omelet , below hot temperatures and the bacon was so over cooked it crumbled on the plate when you touched it .
source***Pizza , the only pizza in NYC that should not have additional toppings , the crust tastes like the best , freshly baked bread !
target***Fan noise , The fan made a constant hissing noise in the background .
target***Also I typed faster then then letters would show and it got to be realy annoying .
source***One should not go to Lucky Strike for the food .
target***This is not a serious gaming laptop or a serious media machine ;
target***It is so simple to use , I use it more than my desktop .
source***By far the best salad I have had in a fast food restaurant .
source***I have been there many times , and food is good and consistent .
source***Wonderful strawberry daiquiries as well !
target***seriously why have n't they just replaced it by now .
source***The large selection of bruschettas , paninis , tramezzinis keep the palate from stagnating .
target***I am constantly trying to uninstall programs , clean cookies , and delete unused files .
target***No Viruses !
source***The pizza here is delicious .
target***The LED backlit display makes my pictures pop so much more .
source***One of us actually liked the expresso , that 's it .
target***In addition , there is photo detection software that will allow you to group all the photos together based upon the people in the picture .
source***Drinks way over priced .
target***More times that not the screen pops up saying I have a bad internet connection , or the page ca n't be displayed .
target***Externally the keys on my keyboard are falling off , after a few uses the paint is rubbing off the button below the mouse pad and where the heals of my hands sit , and the screen has a terrible glare .
target***This is an over - sized , 18-inch laptop .
target***Apparently there is a manufacturing defect , something with the amount of thermal paste .
source***We got a little tipsy from the sake but is n't that what Saturday nights with the girlfriends are all about ?
source***I will not be coming here at 3 am again .
source***people are rude bit again it 's new york !
target***Thinking about returning it
target***You have to toss out the wifi card and replace it just to have any sort of network capability .
target***mac is extremely different than any other laptop .
target***lots of preloaded software .
target***The benefits were immediate !
source***I think the stuff was better than Disney .
source***but the service was a bit slow .
source***Have the iced tea .
source***I am a 100 lb girl , had a glass of wine and a glass of beer prior to the dinner , and I was still HUNGRY after my visit to this place !
source***Lucky Strike is a great casual place to just grab a bite to eat .
target***Overall , I experienced a huge change in that my mac runs pretty fast compared to my old PC .
target***The biggest problem is that the box had no instructions in it .
source***We were told that they were booked solid and no other table was available .
target***No problems , no lock ups , no disappointments .
source***Jimmy is Dominican !
target***You can do it all on this bad boy but the main thing this netbook was desinged for was surfing the web and boy o boy does it ever .
source***great wine list italian , good food , service was INITIALLY fine .
target***Its been a year and am still waiting to see what there going to do about my laptop .
target***return it .
source***We would like to thank Marcelo and Grace for a wonderful dining experience ! ! !
source***I really liked the noodle dishes at Rice Avenue compared to their Green Curry dish .
target***Clearly , there is something wrong with the product and LG did n't take up the responsibility .
target***I think the manual is somewhere on the hard drive , but I rather have a hard copy .
source***This place is the most Japanese it can ever get .
target***I have Vista , so I am unable to install and unASPECT2 some programs .
source***The crust is thin , the ingredients are fresh and the staff is friendly .
target***I got it back and my built - in webcam and built - in mic were shorting out anytime I touched the lid , mind you this was my means of communication with my fiance who was deployed but I suffered thru it and would constandly have to reset the computer to be able to use my cam and mic anytime they went out .
source***Outstanding Bagels , but you get what you pay for .
target***I like how the Mac OS is so simple and easy to use .
source***I think this would be a pretty good spot if it were not so overpriced and overrated .
target***I wish iWork or MS Office came with the Mac , but MS Office does n't even come with most pc laptops .
source***It 's usually packed for good reason , esp .
target***This is now my 3rd MacBook Pro and I really honestly love it !
source***We were very pleasantly surprised .
source***I will be going back very soon .
target***WILL NOT EVERY BUY ANOTHER -- -- -- -- LOU
target***Both my husband and I have this model Toshiba .
target***They freeze all the time .
source***Tuk Tuk is my second favorite neighborhood Thai place the first being Joya .
target***Delivery was early too .
target***Supplied software , The software that comes with this machine is greatly welcomed compared to what Windows comes with .
target***Do not buy it !
target***Recommended to people as their first laptop .
target***Now the machine wo n't connect and Toshiba says that they did replace the connection card in May but they only warranty the repair for 30 days and now I ' m out of warranty even though this has been a constant 5 month occurance since I bought the netbook .
target***It has far exceeded my expectations for power , storage , and abilitiy .
target***I 'll rather be out of date then spend more money on toshiba .
target***Even so , I like playing online games , so it was wonderful that there is a feature where I can dualboot Windows .
source***The food is consistently wonderful , I ' ve been coming here for years , and the owner has always been accomodating and friendly .
target***It has many great programs , such as ILife , iPhotos and others .
target***Many thanks , Overstockcom .
source***We had a great tiem watching the shows and characters and ar food was just what we were looking for .
target***the place we bought it from said that after they send it out to gateway 4 times they would give us a new one .
source***That is a problem since we paid about 20 bucks a dish , and had to order 5 dish to get a decent taste .
target***I came from the Dell Laptops and now I am so glad I switched when I needed a new laptop .
source***really depends on your luck !
target***Also , my sister got the exact same laptop since they were so cheap and after 8 months , the screen split in half just from everyday use .
source***Acceptable prices .
source***Aside from the bearded , courdoroy blazer professor type with the NYU student he 's sleeping with that week , you see a strange mix of hipsters , frat boys , Will Smith types who need to be told they are black , bitter cougars who ca n't understand why they are nt married yet .
target***This was around three years , maybe four years ago .
target***So , I took it back to the apple store and they narcissist genius bar staff fixed it by resetting the fan at boot up .
target***Emachines says they 're waiting for a part and refuses to replace entire unit .
target***The apple care has never failed me , and I expect it to be the same for this computer as well .
target***Well , maybe I was just very unlucky .
target***Everything is falling apart internally and externally .
target***I took the computer back in yet again except this time they kept it to send into their Geek Squad headquarters .
target***By this time I was regretting ever SEEING this machine on the shelf !
source***Recommended .
source***So all I ' m trying to say is this restaurant is by far the best thai food restaurant I ' ve ever been to .
target***But the Macbook is the best !
target***Once you go Mac , you ca n't go back !
source***Decent wine at reasonable prices .
target***when i called to have another one shipped or to get my money back they said the return policy is 23 twenty three days from the date of purchase .
target***oh yeah , and if the fancy webcam breaks guess who you have to send it to to get it fixed ?
source***Never in my life did I think that I could be satisfied both in taste and in quantity for $ 300 in NYC .
source***It 's a much more grown up restaurant compared to the rest of the street .
source***We are very particular about sushi and were both please with every choice which included , ceviche mix ( special ) , crab dumplings , assorted sashimi , sushi and rolls , two types of sake , and the banana tempura .
source***For those prices and the dressed up atmosphere you expect more and should get more .
target***The delivery was fast , and I would not hesitate to purchase this laptop again .
source***This is , by far , my favorite restaurant in NYC and I only wish it were more affordable so I could go more often !
target***I regret buying it before understanding how awful it is to use .
source***Based on the reviews for dinner , this is a place I would reconsider revisiting for that , but definitely not for Dim Sum again .
source***I am a die hard peep lover .
target***I believe this is because I was more active than the average user , meaning I average about three tabs .
target***At 16 months it started shutting off after only 5 or 10 minutes .
target***The computer is so slow , even after paying staples the extra money to speed it up .
target***I am very pleased with my purchase !
target***We paid for the three year warranty and the extended warranty after that one ended as well .
source***It 's a rather cramped and busy restaurant and it closes early .
source***Just do n't do it .
target***However , this laptop has a fatal flaw that i discovered merely a week after buying it .
target***The computer runs very fast with no problems and the iLife software that comes with it iPhoto , iMovie , iWeb , iTunes , GarageBand is all very helpful as well .
source***The first time the sushi was outstanding , the second time it was a little bland .
target***Yet , HP wo n't do anything about the problem .
target***I fell in love with the hp pavillion and that was my replacement and now I could not imagine going back to an acer at all .
source***We 'd go back again
target***Because it IS a defective product .
source***The sushi has been from average to below average , the wait service has always been sub - par the atmosphere goes from nice to really irritating if you sit in the area beyond the kitchen , the acousitcs are horrid , everything echoes is extremely loud .
source***Joe 's Pizza used to have the best slice until this pizzeria opened up .
target***That was a big mistake .
source***I have been going back again and again .
target***The Toshiba Mini Notebook , Model NB 305-N410BL , is a great little computer .
source***The space is a bit too small for live music , so on jazz nights , it can be loud and cramped .
source***big and soft as well as good lunch food .
source***Okay service .
source***We arrived on time for our reservation and seated promptlyThe .
target***It took so much time .
target***This computer I used daily nice compact design .
source***The staff is also attentive and friendly .
source***The soup for the udon was soy sauce and water .
source***The service was the only thing good about this restaurant .
target***Good monitor and performed well .
source***After the main course came , we did n't see our waiter for at least 40 MINUTES !
target***One of the wonderful things about Macs is that they are virus free .
target***Well , maybe more like week one .
source***Spice is great Thai food , love the inexpensive appetizers .
target***The only downfall is a lot of the software I have wo n't work with Mac and iWork is not worth the price of it .
source***The hot dogs were cold in the middle and the buns were stale .
source***One of my favorite restaurants in the neighborhood .
target***i do n't understand why i spent twice as much to get a laptop rather than a desktop when my lap top is completely immoble .
source***The plain pizza was soggy and the creative wild mushroom(third generation - Fornini ) pizza we had was drenched with truffle oil in the middle again making it soggy and nothingon the rest .
target***i tried turning it done but it did nothing .
source***Their exotic salad is basic ly a delcious little green salad with a peanut sauce that is perfect before their sweet basil fried tofu .
target***I ' ve owned every Pro model Apple laptop for the last 8 years , this is BY FAR the WORST one I ' ve ever had .
source***Quality ingredients preparation all around , and a very fair price for NYC .
target***Oh yeah , do n't forget the expensive shipping to and from HP .
source***Food is great .
target***I BOUGHT THEM FOR MY COLLEGE AGE GRANDCHILDREN AND THESE MACS ARE TOTALLY RELIABLE AND SUPPORT THEIR CLASS WORK 100 % OF THE TIME .
source***I have to say I have never had a disapointing meal here .
source***Appetizers are somewhere around $ 7 each and the main dishes are between $ 11 and $ 16 .
target***I looked around and based off my price comparison from a brand I trusted I landed here .
target***I always swore by PCs and would never consider a MAC .
source***Although , one night we went it was super cheesy , and another night it was less cheesy .
source***It is the best hidden spot there and I rave about it to everyone .
source***Both times I was extremely dissappointed by the service , which was boarderline rude .
target***We were PC users .
source***Make sure you try this place as often as you can .
source***The main downside to the place is the nazi - like guy running it who constantly complains about the noise level .
target***As usual at customer service center , she asked me to hold for a moment while she went to the back - office and compare it with other same model netbooks and discussed it with her colleague I could see them .
target***It does run a little warm but that is a negligible concern .
target***This is a great laptop and I would recommend it to anyone .
source***Wait staff is blantently unappreciative of your business but its the best pie on the UWS !
target***COMPUTER HAS BEEN AT SERVICE FACILITY MORE THAN IN MY HANDS .
target***Overall though , for the money spent it 's a great deal .
source***Decor is nice and minimalist , food simple yet very well presented and cooked , and the wine list matches the food very well .
target***I shipped out on Saturday , July 17 .
target***I do n't like this company nor the toshiba brand , and I 'll never buy another one because I ' ve put more into it then it is worth .
target***If you want a little more custom ability , drop a few bucks and upgrade to one of the more robust versions of Win 7 and grab a 2 GB stick of memory to spice it all up a bit more .
source***Never again !
source***We got most of it back at home with us .
source***This is n't a value joint .
target***The computer loads in about a 1/10th of the time that my PC did , and I have all of the programs that were on my PC .
target***I use my friends and family 's $ 2000 laptops and they are fast and reliable and HP , well , I 'll never buy or recommend an HP to anyone !
source***Cornelia Street looks like a Broadway set for West Side Story and the inside of Po is so cool quaint you really ca n't top the setting for a romantic dinner in NYC .
target***It 's not a recommendation , it a plea .
target***It is easy to use , has great screen quality , and every so light weight .
target***The Mac Snow Leopard O / S is extremely easy to use , although very different than Win XP , Visa or Win7 .
source***This place is worth going even if only for their beer .
source***The quality of food at this restaurant accompanied by fantastic live jazz makes this place a perfect 10 !
source***Aside from the Sea Urchin , the chef recommended an assortment of fish including Fatty Yellow Tail , Boton Shrimp , Blue Fin Torro ( Fatty Tuna ) , Sea Eel , etc .
target***It still heats up like mad and I am unable to use it with the computer directly on my lap for more than five to ten minutes at a time .
source***The food is above average for midtown and sligtly better than some of the other Heartland Breweries in the city .
target***Only thing I would want to add to this is an internal bluray read / write drive .
source***We usually go to the Chart House to celebrate a birthday or anniversary .
target***THEN , one month after the warranty expired , the replacement charger went .
source***Leon is an East Village gem , casual but hip , with well prepared basic French bistro fare , good specials , a warm and lively atmosphere .
target***The Mac takes about the same amount of starting - up time as the average PC , but keeps itself cleaned up and ready to use .
target***Adjust the sensitivity since it 's not that responsive to begin with .
source***I brought some buddies from CA and they loved it .
target***The processor went on me , the fan went and the motherboard went .
target***I challenge anyone to show proof that through anywhere near normal use can get more than 25 hrs out of it .
target***The screen is framed by half to a full - inch margin that is obviously unnecessary , reduces the screen size and increases the bulk .
target***Then after 4 or so months the charger stopped working so I was forced to go out and buy new hardware just to keep this computer running .
source***We always get a sampling of appetizers and share .
target***I bought this laptop so that the entire family had a computer in the living room ;
source***Food is usually very good , though ocasionally I wondered about freshmess of raw vegatables in side orders .
target***After that I turned to email in my next vain help to get them to acknowledge that the warranty was still valid .
source***The beverages were excellent , and the dessert was good .
source***IT WAS HORRIBLE .
source***There was a small wait , but shorter than I expected .
source***Will give it another chance before I write it off .
source***I live on the street this place is on .
target***It crashes , and when it goes flat , it just DIES like a PC , maybe worse and I loose all my open documents !
source***The fried rice is really good too .
source***This place must have cost the owners afortune to build .
source***It can not be the ambience , because the place is very cramped and some guests have to sit in an aisle .
target***You may soon mistake my digitus medius as a lively pogo stick .
source***By far , the best pizza in Manhattan .
target***To list a few , They tend to get hot enough to cause 3rd degree burns , as well as ignite any flamable material if near the part that happens to heat up .
target***I ' m just really happy that I waited to buy , because this thing kicks a $ $ !
source***I ' ve been there a few times , and I usually end up sitting next to some pretty odd people .
target***I am now frustrated that I still have to use my work issued Windows laptop !
source***Very different than regular dimsum places .
source***Dip the ingredients in with your chopsticks , swirl them around , and eat .
target***Which is what I did , check out my ACER 5517 !
target***I found a 2 GB stick for a bit under $ 50 Nice and portable and definitely a decent enough system to keep you entertained while sitting in the airplane for a couple of hours , or at the hotel taking care of some last minute details and documents .
target***Once I removed all the software the laptop loads in 15 - 20 seconds .
source***While the staff at this little bistro is very friendly , I have never experienced more incompetency .
target***Yeah , of course smarty pants fix it nowASPECT1 , Compared to the early 2011 edition I did see inbuilt applications crashing and it prompted me to send the report to Apple which I promptly did .
source***so garantuan that you ca n't fit them in a toaster .
source***I definitely would n't go back .
source***There is also very limited seating and there can be a substantial wait in getting food at peak times .
target***I just plug this into my 22 " Monitor and the speedy MacOSX performs just as well on this dual - core that my Dell did with Windows 7 with a quad - core .
target***I have no idea how this could have even gotten past quality control during production .
source***If you can handle that , it 's a great place for a business dinner , fun with friends or simply a table for 2 .
source***Try the green curry ! ! !
source***I love when restaurants think using fancy expensive ingrediants makes the food fine cuisine , even with no idea how to use them .
source***I try my best to give an accurate description of any establishment visited .
source***The atmosphere is great if your looking for a laid back scene and an inexpensive way to spend a weekend afternoon .
source***Enjoy !
source***it 's the only place you can get yummy authentic japanese comfort food .
target***I love the Mac so much better than my work PC !
target***i use my mac all the time , i love the software , the way it takes a short time to load things , how easy it is to use and most of all how you do n't have to worry about viruses .
source***Nothing fancy but really good food with pretty reasonable price .
target***Toshiba is a great brand , even though I have n't had it for a long time , I am very happy with it !
source***If you live outside the neighborhood , do n't bother !
target***it ca n't fuction well with lots of webpages open at once .
source***They are located in the middle of Chinatown !
source***The spicy tuna roll was unusually good and the rock shrimp tempura was awesome , great appetizer to share !
source***I found the food to be outstanding , particulary the salmon dish I had .
target***There is no cd drive on the computer , which defeats the purpose of keeping files on a cd .
target***I would definitely suggest this laptop !
target***I took it back to Best Buy where they were so helpful and immediately gave me a new one .
source***It 's constantly open , catering to the Pakistani cabbies lined up on Crosby St , so there 's more turnover with the food than you 'd expect ie , surprisingly fresh .
target***Returned laptop for a 3rd repair and it came back with previous problems fixed except for speaker grill but the unit started locking up during use and eventually would not operate at all .
target***Otherwise , I love it !
source***I ordered a Lassi and asked 4 times for it but never got it .
source***From the moment you enter till the moment you walk out the friendly and helpful staff was was just Fantastic .
source***A little noise but I think that was because of our party !
source***Very romantic fires , I ' ve literally spent hours at Lanterna , drinking wine from their extensive wine and enjoying the ambience .
target***Summary , Do nt buy HP .
target***Amazing machine .
target***The machine is slow to boot up and occasionally crashes completely .
source***You 'll pay at least double at any other Italian restaurant in the city , and most still do n't compare .
target***I ca n't even install one of the 3 printers I have in my house so I am unable to print .
target***It would take up too much time to do reaearch for my papers and I would be up hours - just because the computer was too slow .
target***After way too many times sending the thing in for repairs delivery service was slow , and without the laptop I had no access to the internet , and thus no way of tracking it to find out when I might hope to see my computer again , it finally kicked the bucket after just over 2 years .
source***Sexy .
source***They were such a rip - off $ 895 for four small meat patties in steamed buns and not worth trying .
target***Eventually the screen went blank and the computer would not turn on .
target***It 's very annoying .
target***The brand is tarnished in my heart .
target***The keyboard , which generally felt okay even for someone used to a desktop keyboard , now looks terrible .
source***Highly recommend this as great value for excellent sushi and service .
target***I was so excited to receive the Toshiba L455 as a gift / bonus for some work I had done for a friend of mine !
source***There was no ambiance .
target***But to be honest , I do n't use my computer for anything like graphics editing and complex data analysis and gaming .
target***-4 RAM slots , 2 HDD Bays , 16 GB RAM support -No Wireless Issues , at least for me .
target***It Was a great deal after all .
source***I ordered a Chicken Teriyaki dish and found that the chicken was extremely dry .
source***Even with the prix fixe pricing , this restaurant is not worth it .
target***The best thing is even while doing almost ten or twenty things at once , it never slows down .
source***This is one of our all - time favorite .
source***We were also seated promptly at the time of our reservation and the service was very quick and professional .
source***Although be warned their dinner menu to sit and take out prices are different .
source***They do n't seem to place an emphasis on specials or fresh ingredients which to me is necessary for good thai .
source***Nothing special about this place .
source***skip dessert .
target***I did have to replace the battery once , but that was only a couple months ago and it 's been working perfect ever since .
source***The only possible drawback to this last point is that as of the date of this posting , the additional menu items are only written in Chinese .
target***Not sure how I recommend it for quality gaming , as I have a desktop rig for that reason .
target***and its really cheap and you wo nt regret buying it .
source***I must warn the reader that the portions sizes are very small especially the appetizers , so if you plan to eat until you are full and do not intend to order the chef 's special tasting menu , prepare to order and pay for an appetizer 1 dish for each person because the portions are not for sharing , a main entree , and the cold udon at the end of the meal .
target***I do n't use my laptop in a way though that needs a long battery life so it 's perfect for me .
source***Went for a late weekday lunch .
target***The macbook rarely requires a hard reboot .
target***It has worked fine .
target***Only other thing is that if you are using this for document creation Apple does nt provide any kind of word processor such as works for windows , but iwork is cheap compared to office .
source***We started with lox and mussels the best i ve ever had , ever and had the cod and trout for dinner .
target***I would easly reccomend this laptop to a friend .
source***It 's easy to get a table for a large group and you do n't get hustled out .
source***While they keep the capex to a minimum , they do put some cash into the bagels , because they among the best in the city .
target***In all honesty , if someone is looking for a quality laptop and willing to pay a little more money for a normal sized laptop than a cheaper and less impressive laptop , then do not buy this computer .
target***Finally , the biggest problem has been tech support .
source***The food however , is what one might expect .
source***The sushi is average and the prices are anything but .
source***I have never eaten in the restaurant , however , upon reading the reviews I got take out last week .
source***Rosario 's is without a doubt one of the greatest pizzerias in existence .
source***So eat fast and order a lot .
source***Went there with my wife and we had to wait for a table even though you could see there many that were empty with not reservation sigh on them .
source***I can not recommend OG more highly if I tried , check it out for yourself .
target***I considered I may have too much on the computer , but after looking , there was plenty of space and that is not the issue .
source***My husband had the mesclun , salmon , and ice cream and he enjoyed all 3 courses .
target***Anyway , in early July of this year , the DVD burner stopped working , and the computer stared having issues with power supply .
source***Slightly above average wines start at $ 70 + with only one selection listed at $ 30 + .
source***I LOVE their spicy scallop roll , and my boyfriend consistently gets the sesame chicken .
source***Go girls ! ! !
source***The bagels always warm , soft on the inside , crispy on the outside and enormous in size .
target***About 2 months ago i bought the 2011 macbook pro , which was an upgrade from my 2010 macbook pro .
target***It is a big big , but since it has a 184 screen what would you expect ! .
target***By the time I was finally able to get a work order to get it fixed I had been without my computer for almost a week while I was an Online College Student , so it was very inconvenient and I had to send it off and be without it while it was being fixed also .
source***However , I think Jeckll and Hydes t is one of those places that is fun to do once .
source***A cool bar with great food , and tons of excellent beer .
target***Please , anyone who is considering getting this computer , stop .
target***To those thinking about switching , do it and do not look back !
source***however , it 's the service that leaves a bad taste in my mouth .
target***But guess what ? you have to buy an external dvd drive it does n't have a built in type The notebook ca n't be used because it does n't read anything for an external drive .
target***The cool thing about the Mac Book was that I went on my honeymoon and shot a bunch of pictures and movies with my iPhone , then I came back and put them onto my Macbook and made a pretty good DVD movie with all the pictures and videos from my trip .
target***Mostly I love the drag and drop feature .
source***The waiters and owners were nonchalant about this and promised to call the exterminator but were n't as dismayed or apologetic as I would have expected .
source***The food is great .
source***The only other steakhouse that seems to hold a candle to Roth 's is the Strip House .
target***When I got my laptop back after this first instance it worked okay for a little bit then I started expeirencing issues again , everything from programs and drivers failing again , to it powering off for no reason , to locking up and freezing and just all sorts of issues .
source***Please save yourself the frustration .
source***I ca n't wait to go back .
source***When we stumbled on Leon , we thought that we had found quite the gem BUT , we were certainly wrong .
target***This time the mouse pad and right click key would n't work !
target***I would tell the technician I knew exactly what was wrong with it but they did not listen and I had to go through a bunch of junk to get them to tell me I needed to send the computer in .
source***The sides were ok and incredibly salty .
target***The fact that you can spend over $ 100 on just a webcam underscores the value of this machine .
source***The staff was too busy ordering sushi for dinner and then laying it out to eat on the bar to even bring me my check .
source***If the weather is nice , try to snag an outside table .
target***Everything else just install and go .
source***Every waitress and customer who passed by me bumped into my chair .
source***Fish was overdone .
target***Well , I had completed the presentation in powerpoint the night before on my PC , but took the Apple to the conference .
source***And cheap !
source***It 's a really great deal , considering we got full off of four dollars .
target***It was definelty a smart move .
target***Dells are ok , HPs are n't that good , but Macs or Fantastic .
source***Kudos to Po !
source***Try the lasagnette appetizer .
source***i happen to have a policy that goes along with a little bit of self - respect , which includes not letting a waiter intimidate me , ie make me feel bad asking for trivialities like water , or the check .
target***I went right out and purchased another laptop .
source***I have eaten there 3 - 4 times and the food was always good .
source***Great wine selection , Gigondas is worth the price , and the house champagne is a great value .
target***-They say it will take up to two weeks .
target***Many kinds of software that is necessary to the working person is not available and can not be downloaded .
source***And they provided a delicious dessert on the house !
source***Do n't expect to sit down inside though , there are only a few tables and they are always full .
source***Mermaid Inn is an overall good restaurant with really good seafood .
source***Save yourself the time and trouble and skip this one !
target***I occassionaly use it for work via VPN and it has not given me any problems .
target***Everything about the Mac is not only visually appealing , but very easy to use .
target***This is the first Apple product that I have purchased .
target***It could be a perfect laptop if it would have faster system memory and its radeon 5850 would have DDR5 instead of DDR3 .
source***They are often crowded on the weekends but they are efficient and accurate with their service .
target***I worked in IT retail sales before .
target***Other Thoughts , I love newegg , I recommend them to the world however this is just unacceptable .
target***I will not buy another one .
source***Stick to the gulab jamun .
source***The food is great and they have a good selecion of wines at reasonable prices .
target***I needed a driver for my HP and they would not help me with out me paying over $ 50 for it .

target***I have had it for almost four years now and I have only had a few problems with it .
source***If you have a dumpling fetish i suggest you try some here !
target***I let my friend borrow it , and she knows nothing about computers , and she used it with ease .
source***This is the Cheers of New York , whether you ' ve ever been there or not .
target***Speaking of the browser , it too has problems .
source***The menu may be small , but everything on it is delicious .
source***Salads are a delicious way to begin the meal .
source***The pizza is delicious , they use fresh mozzarella instead of the cheap , frozen , shredded cheese common to most pizza 's .
source***I was a little leary about Mary 's at first , it 's small , crowded and you usually have to wait on line , but I ' m glad I finally tried it .
target***Breaking within 1 year of purchase and speaking to 4 + people to report the damaged part will be returned late !
source***Oh yes , and if you are a fan of Indian oldies film stars , there are plenty of portraits of Indian actors and actresses in classic black white that adorn the walls , some of which , I would love to know where they obtained .
source***We were pleasantly surprised .
source***Bravissimo ! !
source***May , the owner always has a smile on her and will warmly greet you .
target***We researched and found the best price at MacConnection .
source***If you 're looking for a place to sit down , have a drink and conversations with friends , go to sweet - n - tart and order yourself a hong - kong styled milk and tea with tapioca pearls ( hot ) .
target***First it burned or fused the power adapter plug .
target***But as time went on I found it almost impossible to keep the thing on - line through wi - fi .
target***You will regret it if you buy any dell .
source***We ordered some beef and noodle soup dishes from the Thai section of the menu but nothing we got was Thai .
target***i would have to say that overall its great !
source***For the people who want great food plus great service , Roxy is a place to AVOID !
source***The only thing more wonderful than the food which is exceptional is the service .
target***The only thing I did n't learn in my research was the software I would need like privacy protection and warranty protection , in case it gets broken , or crashes etc .
target***One bad thing is it gets hot .
target***Since I purchased my Toshiba netbook , I have been very pleased with it , I have a laptob and a desktop .
target***Great product by Apple with the new great looking design .
source***Also , the hostess called me today to thank us for coming and mentioned how she hoped that my girlfriend enjoyed her birthday , unexpected , but a truly above and beyond thing to do .
source***Quality of food is excellent and price is cheap , stick to pork , fish , chicken , lamb and vegetables .
target***I ' m a professional consultant , and a client needed work on her machine .
source***I would defiantly come back here again as one of my top choices .
target***and finally i realized that mac is the best .
target***Time will tell .
target***THIS LAPTOP WAS BAD FROM THE FIRST DAY OF USE -- -- BROUGHT IT BACK TO STORE FOR RETURN OF MONEY .
target***Applications open in seconds and there are no lags , hiccups or awkward moments when you wonder whether your computer is out for tea .
source***Service was warm and attentive , beef carpaachio was exellent huge portion and pasta was fresh and well - prepared .
source***I have enjoyed everything I have ever gotten and the fish is so fresh and always prepared in a great way .
source***The place was n't too hard to find , but it was kind of packed , as soon as my boyfriend and I got our food , the line reached the door .
source***But the staff was so horrible to us .
source***Usually 3 vs 4 items per dish .
source***Finally a reliable Chinese restaurant !
target***I ca n't imagine EVER buying a PC again !
target***Great Laptop for the price , works well with action pack games .
source***The place does get crowded , so I recommend going between 4 - 5 PM .
source***She gets 10 for her excellent service and advice .
target***That seemed to solve the problem , till I wrote an article with semicolons in it .
target***The 13 MacBook Pro is portable , durable , and very capable .
source***Would definitely visit again .
target***Iphoto is great for adding pictures right to facebook and other social networking sites .
source***I pray it stays open forever .
source***Should you happen to be impressed by the cuisine definitely try it .
target***I mainly use it for email , internet , and managing personal files pics , vids , etc .
source***Went on a 3 day oyster binge , with Fish bringing up the closing , and I am so glad this was the place it O trip ended , because it was so great !
source***And really large portions .
target***I know what 7 hrs of battery looks like .
target***It was a great laptop , ran great and was really fast .
source***He was terribly thirsty after the meal too .
source***Two words , Free wine .
source***I had very high expectations for this place and made a reservation a couple of months in advance for a special occasion .
target***Other installed features , such as certain printer software , are also most attractive .
target***The unibody design is edgy and durable .
target***It is much faster than my desktop which is a Core2 Quad running at 283 GHz .
source***Luckily we saved room for the BBQ Salmon , Sea Bass and Crispy Duck .
source***A large is $ 20 , and toppings are about $ 3 each .
target***The battery holds up well , it 's built very solidly , and runs fast .
target***Enough said .
source***The food itself was just ok , nothing spectacular , but the service was awful .
source***Of course , it is crowded but who cares .
source***We were looking forward to nice glass of Sangria when we arrived .
source***I went to Ruby Foos for my birthday and enjoyed our experience there .
source***service is friendly , and never had a problem walking in and getting a table .
source***Suan has challenged this loyalty .
target***Never had a single problem , and do n't have to worry about viruses .
target***Not even safe mode boots .
source***The staff was very attentive , the ambience lovely , and the food superb .
source***While the food was good certainly no Il Mulino the service was horrendous .
target***I definatly ca n't .
source***The place is sleek , modern and playfull and i will return again frequently .
target***I homeschool my kids and with this netbook next to my desk we get to teaching and illustrating without skipping a beat .
source***I ' ve been to at Cafe Spice probably 5 - 8 times , it is probably still the best Indian restaurant around Union Square .
target***A tip for people looking into this computer , DO NOT BUY IT save up a bit more money and buy a computer that will last .
target***I was also able to install and use my Photoshop and AfterEffects programs easily .
target***Obviously , this Macbook is P - E - R - F - E - C - T for me because it does exactly what I need in an easy - to - function way .
target***Pairing it with an iPhone is a pure pleasure , talk about painless syncing , used to take me forever , now it 's a snap .
source***Since my first dinner I have had the chance to have brunch at Orsay 3x .
target***My wife recently purchased an Apple MacBook Pro and our granddaughter fell in love with it and asked for one for her birthday .
target***The battery life was supposed to be 6 hours , but even if I ran off the battery with the high effeciency setting the battery would only last me on average about 25 to 3 hours .
source***The restaurant is rather small but we were lucky to get a table quickly .
source***The decor is dark , cool and soothing , while the food 's presentation is spectacular , considering the low prices .
source***Threw my fiance 's surprise 30th birthday dinner here could n't be happier .
target***The iBook backup also uses a firewire connection .
target***It 's A MAC ! !
target***There are several programs for Garageband Pages , Garageband , Garageband , etc , music Garageband , photo management Photo Booth , iPhoto , video - editing or movie - making iMovie , etc .
source***Overall I was impressed and will return , it 's a great QPR Quality to Price Ratio .
source***It was good , but was not what I thought it would be .
source***Service friendly and attentive .
source***I go and eat out at many different restaurants and this is one place you have go and try .
source***We also ordered two hot dogs thinking they would be pretty good since there is a whole section on the menu devoted to them .
source***Decor leaves something to be desired .
target***The book is useless .
target***the mouse is way way way to sensitve .
source***Not someplace I would seek to try out but if I am in the area again , I will certainly stop by .
target***Overall , this is a wonderful computer and definitly worth the purchase !
target***I spoke with a service rep at Micro Center and his girlfriend is having the same problem with her power adapter , so it 's not just an isolated incident ! ! !
source***There is a real gallery of stars that have visited .
target***I will have to say that I love my MacBook Pro !
source***Taj Mahal offeres gret value and great food .
target***THIS HAS BEEN NOTHING BUT A HEADACHE SINCE WE PURCHASED IT .
target***For those that care about noise this thing does n't really make any ;
target***It 's also very capable of doing moderate video editing although you may need the performance boost of the larger MacBook Pros for heavy duty mobile video editing .
source***the food was undercooked - the sauce watery , and the vegetables raw .
target***I am not happy at all with the product I purchased .
target***It does n't bother me though .
source***I ' m from sichuan , this is the restaurant I recommend going .
source***As a Japanese native , I ' ve lived in the Tristate area for over 8 years , but I was just so amazed at this place .
source***The have over 100 different beers to offer thier guest so that made my husband very happy and the food was delicious , if I must recommend a dish it must be the pumkin tortelini .
source***No refills on fountain drinks , though .
source***The food , drinks and service are clearly among the best in the city .
source***during happy hour !
target***It is a much more streamlined system for adding programs , using the internet , and doing other things everyone does on a computer .
target***EITHER WAY , THE KEYBOARD IS UNSATISFACTORY .
target***YOU PAY FOR WHAT YOU GET FOR .
source***the food is decent .
source***Avoid this place !
target***Unless you need the Bluetooth 3 .
target***Its pretty fast and does not have hiccups while I am using it for web browsing , uploading photos , watching movies 720p on occasion and creating presentations .
target***PC users use the Powerpoint program for slide - show presentation and Mac users utilize Keynote .
source***We have been to this place many times , and always have great food , wine , and service .
source***The food was lousy , too sweet or too salty and the portions tiny .
source***PS Please do n't tell anyone in my family i eat there .
source***But that was n't the icing on the cake , a tiramisu that resembled nothing I have ever had .
target***at first !
target***It is amazing .
source***But I just would like to say I read the reviews people left and that s why I checked it out .
source***The food was absolutely amazing ! !
target***I was ready to take it back for a refund , but the Geek Squad camed through and pointed me in the right direction to get it fixed .
source***Quite frankly , this is some of the worst sushi I have ever tried .
target***The computer will constantly be getting hot and burning your leg unless you go through the hassle of taking off the entire back of it just to clean out the fan .
source***Great for large groups and celebrations , our SUPER HAPPY waiter was the entertainment of the evening .
source***Our friendly server made great food suggestions and also sent both the sommelier and the fromager to the table to help suggest different pairings for wine and cheese .
source***It 's very spicy but not offensive .
target***It 's fast and has excellent battery life .
target***the screen brightness automatically adjusts .
target***Have purchased many products over the years from MacConnection and this transaction , like all the others , we smoothly with no problems .
source***The food was just OK , I would never go back .
source***The food was very good , a great deal , and the place its self was great .
target***The Windows 7 Starter is , in my opinion , a great way to think about using your netbook , basics , basics , basics .
source***I would definitely recommend Mary 's and am making it one of my regular neighborhood haunts .
target***Avoid this model .
target***It is in the best condition and has a really high quality .
target***Dell sucks
target***really no problems with the hand me down computers I received from my children .
source***The food , served in small tasting portions as an option is very good with each dish being better than the next .
target***This laptop does everything I need it to very well .
source***I got the $ 10 10-piece dim sum combo , every bite of which was great .
target***It would n't fit in most 17-inch bags .
source***Late nite omelletes are not good here , there is no variety !
source***Try sushimi cucumber roll .
source***Food .
source***Perhaps .
target***I ' m pleased .
source***Be sure to try the seasonal , and always delicious , specials .
source***This place is always very crowded and popular .
target***This has happened three times so far .
target***Looking to take my video and photo editing to the next level , I decided to purchase the MBP 15 in Intel Core i5 after reading consumer reviews as well as professional reviews of this laptop .
target***I had upgraded my old MacBook to Lion , so I kind of knew what I was getting , but had n't been able to enjoy some of the awesome new multi - touch features .
target***It was super easy to set up and Is really easy to get used to .
source***The service was attentive and her suggestions of menu items was right on the mark .
target***Did n't expect to repair it at once !
source***Worth it for a special occasion , or any time !
target***Hope this helped !
source***The wine selection by the glass and bottle is wonderful and I always recommend that friends make a reservation if they 're going to be in town .
source***The dishes offered were unique , very tasty and fresh from the lamb sausages , sardines with biscuits , large whole shrimp to the amazing pistachio ice cream the best and freshest I ' ve ever had .
target***I love the 15 MacBook Pro .
source***The seats are uncomfortable if you are sitting against the wall on wooden benches .
target***I was disappointed when I realized that the keyboard does n't light up on this model .
target***It gives me the power and speed that I need to run all the programs I use to edit .
target***Now the screen is going darker , darker , darker .
target***-ASPECT0 will take a bit of time to get used to .
target***I have never had to shut down the computer unexpectedly and the computer has never froze on me .
source***Service was also horrible and the ambience is not that great .
source***I loved it and would HIGHLY RECOMMEND .
source***This is probably one of my new favorite places .
target***While Apple 's saving grace is the fact that they at least stand behind their products , and their support is great , it would be nice if their products were more reliable to justify the premium .
source***Prices are very good .
target***I ' ve had my Macbook Pro since August 2009 .
target***Worth the investment and truly a fine piece of equipment .
target***I think that if it is the motherboard again so soon that they should replace it .
target***I did contact HP and share how unhappy I am .
source***We went to Ino for Valentines .
source***My wife and I went to Orsay for Valentine 's dinner .
target***It 's wonderful for computer gaming .
source***we spent 50 $ $ definetly will come back with my friends ! ! !
target***And i would recommend this to anypne looking for a new laptop .
source***The pizza is overpriced and soggy .
target***First of all , they had no record of me having the 3 year warranty I 'd paid almost $ 400 for , and I had to call in , spend hours on their online chat service , and fax in multiple documents .
target***I bought my macbook a few months ago and it has been my baby ever since .
target***Then the hard drive failed ;
source***Not only is the cuisine the best around , the service has always been attentive and charming .
target***I edit and burn to DVD a lot of video , so I obviously could not live with a non - functioning drive .
target***Strong performance in this device makes use of fun and a strong sense of the era of speed This device serves all modern requirements is a very strong game and is very use for designers .
source***I would go back tho .
target***Typing on the keyboard becomes uncomfortable after extended use due to the sharp edges that your wrists rest on .
source***Sapphire is the only Indian restaurant I go to when I ' m in NYC .
target***The laptop is very lightASPECT1 , can easily carry around in a knapsack full of text books and it barely adds any weight .
target***I love the solid machined aluminum frame , and the keyboard is the best of any laptop I ' ve used .
source***The corned beef was tender and melted in my mouth .
source***Do n't go there !
target***But , at the same time they the company would not and could not do anything about my problem .
target***Seriously considering a larger laptop to replace the Dell
source***-- Eat Club is a roving group of NYC gluttons
source***The menu changed , portions were even smaller than before , a lentil dish was salty beyond edibility , a basmati rice dish lacked flavor .
source***I would definently recommend this restaurant .
source***The food is nothing like its menu description .
source***I also ordered the Change Mojito , which was out of this world .
target***No I am generous calling it slow .
target***I do n't really have a complaint .
target***you can find many laptops with the same performance and even better with lower price , but you can not find the look , easy , applications , and the experience in mac .
source***As we were sitting eating the subpar food the manager proceeded to berate a couple of his employees for putting out the wrong containers for condiments and explained to them how expensive these containers were .
source***they were able to squeeze me in at 6 after i called the night before my anniversary for a friday night reservation and told me they 'd treat us well for the occasion .
target***Many of my classmates computers hard drives crashed .
source***In addition , the food is very good and the prices are reasonable .
target***Overall the computer is very easy to use , the screen is perfect , great computer , my daughter loves .
source***However , if you want great food at a great price and do n't mind the decor , you ca n't beat this place .
source***When my husband and go there , we spend $ 6000 have LOBSTER TAILS UMMMMM need I say more I ca n't say any more , it a place you 'll never forget If you never go , you 'll miss A Meal of your life time .
source***We had a good time .
target***The acer one compuer is a great computer .
target***For the price and what I get out of it has exceeded my expectations .
source***The restaurant is a bit noisy but that is something that can be overlooked once you sit down and enjoy a great meal
target***Its very nice and once you learn the features you will be so happy to have such a sophisticated computer .
source***However it is the ONLY Taiwanese restaurant in town .
target***I can hardly wait to see what s around the next corner .
target***the graphics are awful and the wireless switch it at the top rather than the side which I am used to it being on the side .
source***And affordable .
source***The wait staff is friendly , and the food has gotten better and better !
source***We were a group of 8 and well seved .
target***One year of trying to fix the computer by myself , with help of friends , and even help from computer experts I have given up on trying to fix it .
source***Seriously , this place kicks ass .
source***As soon as my father lifted his pen from the check a chef appeared to usher us out .
source***Have been several times and it never dissapoints .
target***They are not .
source***I found the food , service and value exceptional everytime I have been there .
target***There is nothing to complain about the system .
source***Thanks Bloom 's for a lovely trip .
source***night without a reservation , we had to wait at the bar for a little while , but the manager was so nice and made our wait a great experience .
source***The duck confit is always amazing and the foie gras terrine with figs was out of this world .
target***In the first moth of owning this computer its hardrive failed which had to be replaced .
target***tons of bloatware and junk programs .
source***Even with John 's and Joe 's around the corner , this place will make a name for itself .
target***2The wireless card is low quality .
target***Heck , I like all Mac computers , but they 're all WAY too pricey for the kind of economy the US is going through .
source***However , it is jus too good to not praise it .
source***It hits the spot every time
source***This Thai restaurant is a couple blocks away from Sripraphai another delicious Thai restaurant .
target***This system is not worth the money or trouble trying to get it fix .
target***Being virus - resistant is a huge plus .
target***It is quiet and a real joy to watch work .
source***It is sometimes a little cramped , and can get a little warm , but hello , it 's NYC !
source***Ciao Bella
source***Went here on a friend 's reccomendation .
source***They did n't give us the dinner special until we asked for it .
source***My friend got the mushroom pizza which tasted better .
source***Maybe tomorrow ; -
source***The service is good and the resturant is clean .
target***I would not recommend the purchase of this modle of Toshiba Computer or any Toshiba product for that matter .
target***No luck , although I waited for hours on the phone - Visited MacHouse , they stated the their call center is down due to too many phonecalls difficult to believe .
source***Warm , comfortable surroundings , nice appointments witness the etched glass and brickwork separating the dining rooms .
target***My son said it popped up and he clicked update .
target***i must keep it plugged in at all times because it will not keep a charge for longer than four minutes .
source***And when I visit her I make it a point to eat at Ino at least once daily if not once for the whole trip .
target***It is so much easier to use
source***I had a grat time at Jekyll and Hyde !
target***I love it and the change in lifestyle that came with it .
source***And it all comes at a very reasonable price congee , noodles , and rice dishes are no more than $ 3 - 6 each .
source***When I lived upstate for a while I would buy freeze the bagels and they would still be better than any else .
source***The Thali was small , thoroughly unremarkable , and $ 1495 .
target***And it is impossible to get them back in .
source***I was glad I did .
source***Price no more than a Jersey deli but way better .
target***It started out by randomly ceasing to charge when it was plugged in mousing over the battery icon would read , for example , 74 % , plugged in , not charging , requiring me to unplug it and plug it back in several times to get it to charge .
target***Other Thoughts , Received replacement 16 Days later .
target***I grew up in a design family so it only made sense .
target***We were occasional Mac users before , but most recently owned a budget PC since it is what we could afford .
source***Besides , we were on vacation !
target***In summary , take your money elsewhere .
source***Try their plain pizza with fresh garlic or eggplant .
source***Order the panang duck , it 's fantastic .
target***After numerous calls to Applecare tech support , I was directed to send in my computer ;
source***Go hungry and enjoy .
source***This has got to be one of the most overrated restaurants in Brooklyn .
target***Honestly , this is absolutely wonderful .
source***I found the variety of the sashimi plate to be satisfying , fresh and yummy .
source***All in all a wonderful experience , ca n't wait to come back .
source***Growing up in NY , I have eaten my share of bagels .
target***Was searching online for a power supply when I found this site .
source***The bill is approximately $ 25 for 2 at lunch without drinks .
target***sometimes you will be moving your finger and the pointer will not even move .
target***And having to deal with the company has been a even worse nightmare .
source***Go here for a romantic dinner but not for an all out wow dining experience .
source***Would n't recomend it for dinner !
source***i ' ve been to sapphire twice and both times the food was fine , if not good .
target***the touch pad is fine , again , it 's a real touch pad .
source***Best Taiwanese food in NY !
source***If you go to Roth 's try to be served by Mike , he is GREAT ! !
target***It was truly a great computer costing less than one thousand bucks before tax .
source***This place is not worth the prices .
source***Great staff .
source***Our teenage kids love it , too .
source***Not impressed with the food .
target***The pro is a great product , I wish that the 13 inch models came with the Intel i processors and had a more comfortable edge the edge hurt my wrists .
target***I did not like my acer .
source***We liked it so much , that we will always make it a point to dine here when we visit New York .
target***So I ' m disappointed in that because communicating with my relatives out of the area is a priority .
target***It is VERY easy to type on and feels great , besides the added feature that the keyboard is lighted .
source***All the people that I bring there go back on their own and bring THEIR friends !
source***This tiny restaurant is as cozy as it gets , with that certain Parisian flair .
target***MY ONLY PROBLEM IS I CAN NOT REG THE PRODUCT KEY .
target***Having someone give you a quick tour of how to 's is the best .
source***they did give a 15 % discount at the end , was n't enough , as they knew the service was horrible .
source***For the price , you can not eat this well in Manhattan .
target***He gave me this PC about 3 years ago and up to this point i m still sitting here using it .
target***It is the easiest computer I have ever used
source***Overall , excellent restaurant !
target***The DVD burner broke after burning 3 DVD 'd during that time !
source***I am French and I really felt like home ! ! !
target***It is easy to use , fast and has great graphics for the money .
target***I would recommend this product .
source***Nha Trang , while being notorious for utter lack of comfort and decor , horribly slow wait staff and horribly quick meals , is one of the best vietnamese restaurants i ' ve ever been to the pho is delicious and comes with very fresh vegtables .
target***The battery gets so HOT it is scary .
source***Definitely a once a year treat that I look forward to around the holidays !
target***This is my first LG product .
target***If I have a few hundred dollars to spare , I 'd buy the Pro line though , the 253 and 266 GHz model .
target***I was waiting for this model to be released since January , and have been holding off on buying a Macbook Pro until the new model came out .
target***I have now had it for 15 months and love it .
target***I consider myself an average user and this computer serves my need .
source***Also , do n't plan on asking for your favorite roll , if it 's not on the menu , you ca n't have it .
target***The battery life was shorter than expected .
source***Our favorite meal is a pesto pizza , the house salad , and a good bottle of wine .
source***I went here in the afternoon with a friend .
source***The staff was accomodating , the food was absolutely delicious and the place is lovely .
source***Ca n't wait to go back .
source***I had a great experience .
target***Sorry Toshiba , but 1st impressions do count for something .
source***For two people with tip was less than $ 25 bucks .
source***If you love wine and cheese and delicious french fare , you 'll love Artisanal !
target***But , buy this model and just purchase 4 GB of RAM 2x2 GB for $ 92 or 1x4 GB for $ 99 , and save yourself $ 100 than the other model with 8 GB of RAM .
target***My children wo n't even use it for their school work .
target***Heck , if I had enough money , I would but it as a gift for someone .
source***Did I mention the wine ?
source***Check it out .
target***I tried to upgrade it to a newer version a couple of months ago and I still have the same problem .
target***Do n't waste their money , save it and but a mac .
target***Worse , for the price I could get a * netbook * that outperforms this machine .
target***The company sent me a whole new cord overnight and apologized .
target***For the use it was purchased for it is a good Laptop .
target***1 Payed $ 2200 for a premium laptop
source***And their prices are very high , they actually think that they can get away with charging such prices for such terrible food and service !
source***NO more reservations , expensive tips and annoying stuff .
target***This laptop is insane ! ! !
source***Next time , we would n't dare ordering anything else other than some simple Asian appetizers and drinks .
target***defective software .
source***Delicate spices , onions , eggs and a kick - ass roti .
source***We were exploring Grand Central and did n't want to eat in the food court .
target***It had a seventeen inch screen which I wanted , but I did n't realize at the time it would be such a monster !
target***While the computer seems to be set up in a common sense way rather than in geek - speak , there are certain quirks that can drive you crazy trying to deal with the PC world .
target***Still , this laptop is perfect for all day use at school and work .
target***Three , the mac book has advantages over pcs with linux based os there is very few problems with system performance when it comes to a mac .
source***Try the congee and the donut like deep fried dough they call Ow Ley Soh , a delicious and sweet tasting bread .
target***My mac laptop is fabulous in both areas .
source***For asian fusion , there are many places further downtown .
target***This just keeps having it 's hard drive replaced !
target***The computer is a dream come true .
source***Molto bene !
target***UPDATE , Two years after buying this laptop , I am now the proud owner of a lemon .
source***Try the Pad Thai , it 's fabulous and their prices are so cheap !
source***Others have to go to other restaurants and feel sad until they 're eaten .
target***I love this little one .
source***The place 's decor and hidden bathrooms made for a good laugh .
source***i do n't how this place is still running .
target***It is as good as new .
target***It was a Waste of money from day one !
target***I would rate this computer at 5 stars , but considering it has a short life span I can only give it 1 and implore anyone looking at laptops to stay away from this machine .
source***Try the lobster teriyaki and the rose special roll .
target***Right size and weight for portability .
source***I will have to say , this Bengali Fast Food joint is clearly my favorite .
target***The system it comes with does not work properly , so when trying to fix the problems with it it started not working at all .
source***Delivery is fast too .
source***Big and gawky on the outside .
source***Terrible , terrible management , deserves to be shut - down .
source***Food does n't appear to be cooked on premisis but there 's a high turnover so its pretty fresh .
source***The first 2 courses were very good , but the chocolate sampler was too rich for me and the dessert wine far too sweet .
source***I ' m going back .
source***The service is fine and they allow you to enjoy the view .
source***The waitress , seems to be more concerned of looking good than actually waitress .
target***do a quick search on the internet see if i m the only one .
source***The takeout menu says to keep an eye out for an expanded menu offering more italian dishes , I ca n't wait !
source***Finally !
target***On the twelfth day that I had the notebook , I decided to go to Dell 's website and update it .
source***Been there , done that , and New York , it 's not that big a deal .
target***HOW DOES THE POWER SUPPLY NOT WORK ! ! !
source***Great bagels , spreads and a good place to hang out in .
target***If you do n't feel comfortable doing it yourself , just buy the case and be happy , plus it looks nice , I bought the white one from Best Buy .
target***Excellent product for the money .
target***So I 'd pop them off to see what the problem was , well guess what ? The darn thing would n't go back on .
source***The Steak Tartare is a great bet , they fix it for you at the table .
source***I would have gotten some cole slaw and a knish if my stomach had more space .
target***I play a lot of casual games online , and the touchpad is very responsive .
target***I work in film editing and post production , so I need a laptop that not only has power , but memory and speed as well .
source***However , I think this place is a good hang out spot .
source***I recommend that you try this hidden spot which will surely blowup very soon
source***this is can became on e of the NY Italian Food fare institutions .
source***The lava cake dessert was incredible and I recommend it .
source***Make reservations but expect to be delayed 15 - 20 minutes as the hosting staff was having difficulty seating guests who arrived with a reservation because they probably had a lot of walk ins being so close to Time Square .
target***They sent it off and within 2 weeks I had it back good as new .
target***Unless you do n't care how long it takes to get going , find something else .
source***Went there for an office lunch .
source***While this can hardly be called a restaurant , it is possibly the best deal in Manhatten , $ 4 for a plate heaped with rice and 2 - 3 entrees .
source***I hate this .
target***Yes , the computer was light weight , less expensive than the average laptop , and was pretty self explantory in use .
target***That is pretty sad when they name them specifically .
source***My host asked for appetizers for the group and the waiter gave us not only what we ordered , but some other items that were not ordered .
target***It works exactly like it did the day I took it out of the box .
source***Mine was a little burnt but still delicious with goat cheese and panchetta raddichio was kind of bitter though .
source***Authentic Pakistani food .
source***If you like spicy food get the chicken vindaloo .
target***Took that one home , same thing .
target***Its small enough where I can take it pretty much anywhere , but still has a big enough screen to get everything done .
source***I ' ve never had bad service and the fish is fresh and delicious .
source***Please if your thinking about it go , and stay the wait you wo n't be disappointed .
target***Ok , this is probably the best laptop series ever devised by Apple .
target***i setup my password last night with the password on my other computer .
target***It is extremely user friendly and intuitive .
target***She brought out 2 other identical netbooks and still insist that It is like that one .
source***Yes , the prices are high , but I felt it was worth it .
target***Also , the battery does not last very long at all .
source***I work around the corner and tried it with a colleague for the first time .
target***It is truly a Desktop Replacement .
source***Again , the waitress was awesome .
source***The Pad Thai is excellent here , as well .
source***They are tasty , but I suggest only eating one with meat because they tend not to mesh that well with the average American digestive system .
source***The service does sometimes lack focus and it is not ideal if you are in a hurry but I have never been treated rudely .
source***I love Indian food and consider myself to be quite an expert on it .
source***Each bite of food at Kai was indeed delicious , fresh , and elegant .
target***While it was highly rated , would I like it ? I tried the keyboard at the store , and it seemed ok .
source***I ' ve had to wait only a few times during lunch but this place is definitely worth the wait .
source***You must try the shrimp appetizers .
target***During that time , I had to send it back 3 times .
source***Salads were fantastic .
source***I am not sure if I would call the food here Indian as it is a fusion of what seems to be French with an Indian or exotic touch .
target***Finally was able to reach a young lady in California and ordered the machine and was subsequently given a delivery date .
source***Restaurant was dirty and unkempt .
target***Acer has set me up with FREE recovery discs , when they are available since I asked .
source***I ' ve been here twice now .
target***One suggestion I do have , is to not bother getting Microsoft office for the mac expecting it will work just like you knew it to on a PC .
source***The wine list is interesting and has many good values .
target***the mouse jumps around all the time and it clicks stuff i do n't want it too .
source***My chow fun and chow see was really bland and oily .
source***From beginning appetizers , the scallops were incredible , to the delicious chocolate souffle with rasberry mint sorbet , we were delighted by the taste sensations .
target***The Mac version of Microsoft Office is cheaper than buying the actual and works just as well .
target***Took me 11 hours , 3 trips to different FedEx offices , and brutal conversations with 14 of the worse IT support technicians in the world .
source***I would highly recommend this place to anyone looking for a casual atmosphere that whisks you away to the left bank of the river Seine .
target***When I called Toshiba , they would not do anything and even tried to charge me $ 35 for the phone call , even though they did n't offer any technical support .
source***The second you walk through the heavy vault like door , with people anticipating your arrival you get the sense that you are going to have the dining ride of a lifetime .
target***Unable to boot up this brand new laptop .
target***Called Acer many times , they want me to pay the shipping to ship it to their repair center , I was very disappointed since it is a brand new computer !
target***Tech support tells me the latter problem is a power supply problem and have offered to fix it if it happens again .
target***And the ram the thing that makes it faster comes sporting 2 gigs for high performance to handle more stuff at once and surf the web a whole lot faster than before .
source***I will be returning .
source***This is my fourth try over a two year period , and I ' m done .
source***Kenny the owner is always there and he treats my family like we are part of his family .
source***There are other people waiting !
target***I am really heartbroken to have to post a terrible review .
source***Love YUKA .
target***I bought it from HSN because it was bundled with extra software , but as it turns out , that software just crashes it more often .
target***I have used a computer at work but having your own personal laptop is AWSOME !
source***Really though , where 's the seasoning ?
source***The Pastrami sandwich was like buttah and with pickles and an icy cold beer to wash it down , it was a pleasurable experience .
source***Located at the end of a magnificent block .
target***It super shiny , so you can see the fingerprints easily .
target***I ' m now trying to decide on another Dell model .
source***Frites were delicious if a bit on the thick side .
target***It may take a little getting used to but you do n't have to worry about viruses or other headaches .
source***One thing I liked about this place is that I never felt rushed or pressured to give up my table ot incoming guests .
source***The pizza was delivered cold and the cheese was n't even fully melted !
target***This computer is absolutely AMAZING ! ! !
source***We got in line and were served while in line a bannan fritter .
source***Once for dinner and once for brunch .
target***I took it to friend who temporarily fixed it and I finally paid about 1500 for the extended warranty .
source***This restaurant used to be pretty decent .
target***I got the Macbook and he got a Macbook Pro .
source***It took them 25 minutes to bring our appetizer .
target***We have n't had any problems with it at all .
target***MACS ARE AMAZING ! ! !
target***Completely worth every single penny dime and nickel .
target***I know there are way better laptops out there for the same price , and why spend money on shit when you can go out and get yourself a perfectly decent laptop that does nt suck total monkey balls .
target***Cords coming out the right for power plus cords coming out front for headphones plus network connection on left make for a very messy setup with cords going every direction .
source***The food is alright , some stuff is good , some is not like the steak dish which tends to be dry .
source***My biggest complaint was the un - tasty food although presented well .
target***It is absolutely horrible to use , despite all its so called advanced features .
target***The only objection I have is that after you buy it the windows 7 system is a starter and charges for the upgrade .
target***Fully charged , the MacBook Pro can last about five hours unplugged .
source***Plus , when our entrees were held up in the kitchen on a busy Saturday night , the owner sent over complimentary summer rolls to hold us over !
target***Great wifi too .
source***I just do not understand what the fuss is all about .
source***So much more than the usual bar food , go there to enjoy the menu while sampling one of their hand - crafted beers .
target***I am not much of a computer techie , so I can understand some of the internal problems , though I do have trend micro as an antiviral program .
target***All the programs are easy and straight forward on my MacBook Pro , it is clean and organized , which I always strive to be myself .
target***The battery life is also relatively good .
source***At first i was rolling my ideas of yet another French place on the UES .
source***A friend from Seattle and I went on a Thursday night around 8 , 30 .
source***It 's true , this place is not cheap .
target***There are no gold key numbers too intall programs , you must use the serial numbers that it does not accept and then things are limited as far a working because they are only good for a short time .
source***But the best part about LS is the late night atmosphere , delightfully free of the BTs .
source***The service was excellent , friendly and attentive .
target***I had to wait 3 weeks to get it back and it still is not working properly .
target***My computer was one of the best in the school compared to my fellow classmates .
target***His language was so bad I swore I was taking the turing test , and it was failing .
source***Everything is for sale in here including the sculptured iron statue on the table .
target***Well i got this computer from Best Buy and I have had nothing but problems I bought the computer with a virus .
source***And the Tom Kha soup was pathetic .
target***As a computer science student in college , I find that the portability , longevity , and ease of use of this computer make me shockingly want to do homework more ;
target***i try to use it today and I ca n't logon .
target***Most laptops and notebooks are difficult to key on .
target***Not only are the versions of these programs able to be saved , worked on and opened on both a PC and Mac , the versions of these programs on a Mac are graphically and functionally superior .
source***at taj , vegetarians can rejoice - all the dishes are manna from heaven .
target***It discharges too quickly .
target***With Windows laptops a wireless mouse is an absolute must .
source***If you are a carnivore , come hungry and you will leave more satisfied than you have ever been .
source***We visit at least once a month .
target***I have been very pleased with the performance of this laptop .
target***Without a doubt , the * ASPECT0 * of this laptop is fantastic .
source***Sure enough , exactly 30 minutes later we got the call and were seated promptly .
source***I am bringing my whole family back next time .
target***Browsing , also , was no problem for me when I used itunes which usually slows down my PC .
target***I burned my leg , after lifting it from my desk , and for less than 5 second putting it on my lap to clean my coffee table , so I can place it there .
target***One more tip , please purchase this model and get a 4 GB stick of RAM to save you $ 10
target***The system constantly overheats , the battery life is too short , the case is coming apart , and my core applications that I use every day in my work as a graphic artist run poorly .
source***We could n't carry our conversation as we were routinely interrupted by waitress and servants asking us to order and hinting that we 're taking too much time - amazing , we just sat down .
target***All the customers that come in hate Dell .
source***We laughed when he finally offered us a dessert menu and we left a 10 percent tip , which was generous , I feel .
target***tosiba has a good reputation , my llast computer was an acer .
target***It does not even have the software to play a dvd now .
source***Everything a NY pizza joint should be .
source***IT IS DEFINITELY SPECIAL AND AFFORDABLE .
target***A couple things you should know ,
source***Meat dishes now adorn the selections , although there 's still a large number of vegetarian - friendly choices .
target***Well , I started using Google Chrome , which is a little better , but it freezes too sometimes .
target***It is also extremely pleasing to the eyes without looking too much like an Alienware gaming machine .
target***Screen size is perfect for portable use in any environment .
target***The local computer repair shops send out ads that say along the lines of we can fix almost any problem or computer usually even the trouble some Toshiba satellite .
source***She lives nearby but had never gone to this establishment thinking that it might be too touristy .
target***wonderful features .
source***I have n't been to the other locations .
target***Buy this if you like being tortured , teased , frustrated and wasting twice as much time as you spent using your old Mac .
target***I started hainv problems with it within the first month .
source***This big draw is the all you can sushi here for $ 1995 ! .
source***The food is terrible and overall , I would have to say avoid at all costs .
target***I saved for this laptop for 3 months and I can tell you personally it was worth the wait .
source***You can certainly find restaurants that offer a superior fine dining experience , but for superb food at reasonable prices , La Villa ca n't be beat .
target***Screen is crystal clear and the system is very responsive .
source***Mizu is the Japenese find in Grammercy .
source***Good atmosphere , combination of all the hottest music dress cod is relatively strict except on Fridays .
source***Add to that great service and great food at a reasonable price and you have yourself the beginning of a great evening .
source***Service was good and food is wonderful .
target***The program came with the computer and works beautifully .
target***returned it .
target***They should have included more memory on their computers if they knew Vista would run slowly .
target***For the Bluetooth to work properly , you must install the Launch Manager on the Drivers / Applications DVD , or it will not show after the reload .
source***Interesting selection , good wines , service fine , fun decor .
source***Bring your appetites .
target***The only drawback for me is how dirty the screen gets , and rather quickly too .
target***The only thing that can be updated is the video , other than that you 're all set .
target***I am finding my way around this laptop better than my last one .
target***It is super easy to use .
source***Thius is a must for anyone who loves Shabu - Shabu .
target***for two months , when YOU GUESSED IT .
target***Love the stability of the Mac software and operating system .
source***Our food was great too !
target***Which was way too much money .
source***It 's to die for !
source***Everyone that has ever come here with me has become a convert and returned regularly with their own friends .
source***believe us , we ' ve been eating sushi for over 15 yrs .
target***It was hard to handle and operate at school .
target***Although the price is higher then Dell laptops , the Macbooks are worth the dough .
source***I have to agree with the previous reviewer .
source***I love it .
source***You can not go wrong at the Red Eye Grill .
target***I will only buy apple laptops from now on .
target***1st hand experience is very important , especially for a new customer .
target***I also love the small , convenient size of my laptop , making it a perfect tool for my academic studies .
target***While many people brag about Mac being intuitive , it does take a little time to adjust to coming from a PC , but once I got the hang of it , I do n't want to go back .
target***So we exchanged it for the same on and after 2 hours it did n't work .
target***Maybe this is virus related , maybe not , but the computer has locked up many times , and on two occasions , the screen has simply gone black .
source***The selection changes frequently but the basic dishes are always available .
source***To my right , the hostess stood over a busboy and hissed rapido , rapido as he tried to clear and re - set a table for six .
target***But , like I said before , the only reason I do n't currently have a Mac laptop is because all of their laptops are too pricey .
source***Conveniently located too , being right on Bedford ave .
target***I have never had any issues or problems with my MacBook Pro so far , and it is still as fast as it was when I first bought it .
target***I love the operating system and the preloaded software .
target***The laptop was very easy to set up .
target***It absolutely is more expensive than most PC laptops , but the ease of use , security , and minimal problems that have arisen make it well worth the pricetag .
source***The food was so - so .
target***The leather carrying case , keyboard and mouse arrived in two days from Memphis warehouse .
target***The 17 in Macbook Pro has been a wonderful addition .
source***BE CAREFUL before you request extra spice .
source***The server was really cool and served us our food and drinks with a smile .
source***Went to Village last night for my birthday .
source***I have tried literally every restaurant on curry row .
source***The cold appetizer dishes taste like the way I remember them to taste when I was growing up in Taiwan .
target***That is my only complaint !
source***All the money went into the interior decoration , none of it went to the chefs .
source***This place is incredibly tiny .
source***Although they do the typical what kind of water would you like questions the service was good and overall very relaxing to place to eat .
source***Get the tuna of gari .
source***While I ' m not sure that this happens all the time - this is the kind of treatment that buys repeat business !
target***To be honest i think it was faulty equipment or something but idk .
target***This is definitely a computer worth the money ;
target***The backlit keys are wonderful when you are working in the dark .
source***Were meeting up with some friends for a drink at Lafayette 161 and happened to walk by Thai Angel famished .
target***Easy to carry , can be taken anywhere , can be hooked up to printers , headsets .
source***No thanks ! ! !
target***I go to purchase it on line , and I find out that the device will not be available until almost two months later !
source***I must say it 's a little pricey for the food because it was not as spectacular as the view .
source***sometimes i get good food and ok service .
source***I love Ess - a - bagel , but I live on the west side , so I often go to Murray 's for convenience .
source***now if they could only get a toaster .
source***Pizza and garlic knots are great as well , I order from them quite often and the delivery is always super quick !
target***This machine was a horrible experience .
target***I received this laptop as a gift and let me just tell you that its the worst .
source***I went to Del Frisco 's Friday night with my boyfriend for an 8 , 00 reservation .
target***It just works flawlessly !
target***I also got the added bonus of a 30 " HD Monitor , which really helps to extend my screen and keep my eyes fresh !
source***The food is good , I ca n't lie .
target***Peformance is good for the price .
target***I sent it to them to fix in perfect condition but for what was wrong with it .
source***And the fried clams had just enough kick to them to make em worth eating .
source***It is thick and slightly soggy .
target***It was heavy , bulky , and hard to carry because of the size .
source***Check it out , it wo n't hurt your stomach or your wallet .
target***HAVING HAD EXPERIENCE WITH A TOSHIBA LAPTOP , I WAS DISAPPOINTED TO FIND THAT THE TOSHIBA NB305 LAPTOP HAS MAJOR PROBLEMS .
target***It easily fits into most computer bags but does n't weigh down a backpack or satchel when being carried with spirals and/or textbooks .
source***He ca n't help , they 're bought up so fast .
source***I had the cod with paella spicy and very filling , I ' m a big eater and could only eat half while my boyfriend had the classic fish and chips again , a big serving , at least 5 pieces of fish and a basketful of fries .
target***i will be returning it and switching brands when i get to best buy .
source***The portions are large and the servers always surprise us with a different starter .
source***Grilled whole fish wonderful , great spicing .
source***Out of the hundreds of Italian restaurants in Queens , this is among the best .
source***Definitely not a restaurant to skip !
source***Taxan delicious !
target***My problem was with DELL Customer Service .
target***Tried to make a recovey disk would n't get passed the first recovery disk .
target***Thus , when you carry it at a slanted angle , the screen will topple or slide down , if you understand what I mean .
source***Planet Thai is great !
target***That being said after 2 weeks of owning every time I start it up now it gives me a black screen for 5 - 8 seconds stating pxe - e61 media test error check cable .
source***The food was good too .
source***People dress in suits or evening gowns as well as shirts jeans .
source***I love the fact that the pizza tastes so good and is so cheap .
target***I claim that this has no value to me , the laptop was new anyway .
target***I chose the iBookG4 , a laptop that is an attractive computer with a large screen big enough to please anyone .
source***We ordered the special , grilled branzino , that was so infused with bone , it was difficult to eat .
source***Too cold to enjoy .
source***Stay away from this place .
target***This ai n't it .
source***Deep Fried Skewers are good and still rare to find in NYC .
source***the drinks are amazing and half off till 8 pm .
source***I was there on sat .
source***but I would n't wan na live there .
target***My MacBook Pro has been a huge disappointment .
source***The bartender on my most recent visit was so incredibly rude that I will never go back .
source***Excellent dumplings served amid clean , chic decor .
source***For an untrendy rip - off eat here .
source***Do n't go alone -- -even two people is n't enough for the whole experience , with pickles and a selection of meats and seafoods .
source***Great spot , whether looking for a couple of drinks or quiet dinner .
source***This was the worst dining experience I ' ve ever had .
target***If you need an affordable , entry - level laptop , this will fit the bill .
target***It was a huge monstrosity of a Laptop !
source***This place does n't compare with Mamoun 's in terms of price , freshness , value , and consisent quality , but that 's just my opinion .
target***It is known as Safari , and if you are doing any website work , you should know that many hosting companies do not support it .
target***i love ths notebook .
source***Their eggplant is so delicate , sweet tender !
target***My Macbook was worth after 3 years of use ! $ 375 .
source***The palak paneer was standard , and I was not a fan of the malai kofta .
source***Total hipster - wannabe attitude in an otherwise sweet spot .
target***Sad very SAD .
source***Also , top the meal with a delicious and perfect slice of tiramisu .
source***I lOVE THIS PLACE !
target***It is her first laptop and she is thrilled .
source***When you 're sitting in their main dining room which has a spectacular , hand - painted high ceiling you 'd never know there was a world outside .
target**** IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR A GOOD LAPTOP , THIS IS NOT IT !
target***I purchased two laptops for my husband and 16 year old daughter .
source***I ve been here a bunch of times now and the service is always outstanding .
target***They also use two totally different operating systems .
source***Big thumbs up !
target***When this happened I would have to completely power off my computer and restart it .
source***From the spectacular caviar to the hospitable waitstaff , I felt like royalty and enjoyed every second of it .
target***We carry the netbook around here and there , hence it 's kinda of irritating when the LCD just slide downwards .
target***I now travel with this laptop and my work PC .
target***The service tech said he had tried to duplicate the damage and was n't able to recreate it therefore it had to be their defect .
source***Service is not what one would expect from a joint in this price category .
target***Also , I have had alot of trouble with the shift key to go to other lines .
source***I agree .
target***The internet speed is spectacular .
target***I also own an HP notebook and it does n't even come close .
target***I returned the 2nd laptop for a full refund .
source***i know , you were too busy showing off your vintage tee shirt and looking bored , but my agenda is i ' m here to eat and enjoy the company of friends , seeking a pleasant experience .
source***The food is authentic Italian , delicious !
source***I ate here a week ago and found most dishes average at best and too expensive .
target***Not too much junk software to remove .
target***The powerpoint opened seamlessly in the apple and the mac hooked up to the projector so easily it was almost scary .
target***I droped this once from thetable when my baby girl grabed me one day and IT is still working with NO issues !
target***Best Buy laughed when I told them they should replace it instead of expecting me to be without a computer again for another couple of weeks .
target***With what I do know how to do , the computer works beautiful .
target***Garageband is more for the musicians , and the laptop is equipped with a good working microphone , good enough for beginners and musicians at the intermediate level .
source***Highly recommended .
target***-Apple offers to send replacement and after 10 days I send them the old computer .
source***$ 200 for 2 glasses of champagne , not too expensive bottle of wine and 2 after dinner drinks .
target***and dell and best buy both refused to take it back after i only had it for 1 hour .
source***The noise level was unbearable , conversation impossible .
target***I ca n't imagine my life without it anymore !
target***The battery life also does n't keep up with the claim but still I think macbook is much ahead from the rest of the pack .
source***Wine list is not huge but def well selected .
target***It still seems to be a little lose now but so far seems to be hanging in there .
source***Because of the delicate thin crust , take - out pies get soggy in their boxes .
source***Great food at REASONABLE prices , makes for an evening that ca n't be beat !
source***very good breads as well .
target***I swear they design these things to go to crap after a year so you are stuck and have to buy a new one .
source***If you are in a big group , this place is perfect because it recomends sharing , they have lazy susans on most tables , even families can feel comfortable here .
target***Its good for playing my apps on Facebook or watching movies .
target***If you faintly come close to touching this thing while typing , all craziness may break loose .
source***its a little out of the way if you do n't live in the neighborhood , but definitely worth the trip from wherever you are .
target***I ' m stuck w/ a broken computer .
source***Also , if you do n't want to sit at a certain table , you do n't have to !
target***You may just lose 1 customer for now .
target***If you are looking for a netbook pc DO NOT BUY FROM ASUS ! ! !
target***So you might ask , what did Apple do for me ?
source***This tiny Williamsburg spot is always pleasantly surprising .
source***Over 100 different choices to create your own .
source***I had never had Edamame pureed before but I thought it was innovative and tasty could ' ve used a bit more salt .
source***It 's true , you feel like your in a scene from Goodfellas .
target***Speakers do n't get that loud , but good enough .
source***Its worth the wait though .
target***The price and features more than met my needs .
target***It is easy to go from one keyboard to another .
target***Okay , let 's just start out by saying I am in no way a computer techy .
source***The decor is night thobut they REALLY need to clean that vent in the ceilingits quite un - appetizing , and kills your effort to make this place look sleek and modern .
target***It is everything that I would want in a computer .
target***Sony , Acer , Dell , Packard Bell and Toshiba .
source***I would recommend putting your name down and then getting a drink at a local bar first though because of the wait time .
target***It 's just as fast with one program open as it is with sixteen open .
target***Let me start with the good , So awesome .
source***I thought this place was totally overrated .
target***It 's slow and one day i hope to have the money to get rid of it and buy something else .
source***or sister , in my case ! .
target***The performance is awesome .
target***I take it everywhere with me because it 's so easy to carry .
target***Mine came at $ 1,700 w/o a DVD burner ! .
source***We do not need to go to a four - star restaurant anymore .
source***This is one great place to eat pizza more out but not a good place for take - out pizza .
target***I called Toshiba and they want me to be without my laptop for about two weeks while they look at the problem .
target***This is great if you have several lectures back to back and do n't have a chance to charge during one of the lectures .
target***This laptop looked brand new and was shipped very quickly .
target***I upgraded from a 5 year old laptop and was amazed to find out that this computer is much slower then my old laptop .
target***I bought this laptop the moment unibody product came to the market .
source***Three page wine menu , one page entree and horedevous .
source***Normally that would be improper , however they were all delicious and my host did not complain .
source***But do n't ever order bacon late at nite either platter or in sandwiches , for that matter do n't from any take out place as it is from the morning frying turns out hard almost like bacos , hurt my molars .
source***The specials are usually quite good too .
target***However , my girlfriend realized that the netbook 's hinge is a bit loose when you open or close the LCD .
source***I ' m told that it is open 24hrs which is good .
source***They are the best bagels I ' ve had .
source***and for this i had to shell out a small fortune ?
source***Great atmoshere and worth every bit .
target***LOVE IT LOVE IT LOVE IT !
target***However , I love this particular Mac because its very fast , great size , and has fantastic features like the lighted keyboard and easy mouse pad .
target***Took several hours with customer support before I could even start the PC out of the box .
source***The ambience is very romantic and definitely a good place to bring a date .
target***She said its very user friendly .
target***I ca n't even remember how I finally got it taken care of , but I was done with Sony after that !
source***Hopefully next time , I will save room for dessert .
target***This computer that I have has had issues with the keyboard where it lost half the keyboard functions .
source***The highly spiced chai tea was great too .
target***In my line of work , I often have to take work home , and this makes it so easy .
source***I had a late dinner at Lucky Stike , a great name for a joint if ever I saw one .
source***But the coconut rice was good .
source***Very affordable and excellent ambient !
source***I had been a regular due to the consistently good food and ease of getting a table .
target***I run windows via bootcamp for the couple programs I do not want to buy a mac version of , like my cad programs .
source***I ca n't wait for the nex time .
source***Very excited to hear that short - term Chef Jason Narone has moved on , he truly was a low point of their Sterling track record .
target***Quite simply this is the best laptop I have ever owned .
target***I called back to ensure that received it , they had .
target***I actually contact Toshiba before I started having problem and was given run around after I supplied serial number in order to delay me sending in laptop until after warrenty expired .
source***Skip Baroanda down the street Eurotrashy , snooty and expensive and check this place out !
source***The food here is rather good , but only if you like to wait for it .
source***Anyhow , we were able to sit as long as we wanted and chat , which was nice .
target***I now own another Hewlitt Packard .
target***Could not keep up with me and finally the hard drive went out .
target***The guy then said that if I insist on having the hinge tightened , they can do it for me but I have to accept the condition after the repair .
target***I use iphoto all the time , which is a great program for anyone who is into photography , amateurs and experts alike .
source***What 's the difference between the two ?
target***After that the said it was under warranty .
target***My Mac has gone from being a trusted friend to an adversary .
source***A must try !
target***I have had no problems with it unlike some hardware defects on past models .
target***Summary , They played games with me for the warranty period .
source***go to any corned indian restaurant , and the little india strip along east 6 st rules supreme !
target***Awesome graphics !
target***I should have bought one a long time ago .
target***Two of the times was in one month .
target***Am very glad I bought it , great netbook , low price .
source***They also have a back garden open in the summer , cute and French with outdoor seating , what more could you ask for ?
target***Now mainboard is broken , have to wait for a new one .
target***This computer was awful , I would never recomend it to another person .
target***think i would spend little extra to get a better made laptop .
source***This is one of the best comfort food places in the city .
target***I did a lot of research and ended up thinking this Toshiba was the best one for me .
target***IT IS TRASH !
source***Such nice people working here , but I have to review the food .
source***Do n't dine at Tamarind for the vegetarian dishes , they are simply not up to par with the non - veg selections .
target***I WANT MY L505-s5988 BACK !
target***Though you get a polite person , you often don t get a solution .
target***It 's A MAC ! !
source***and you ca n't beat the prices .
target***If you 're not wanting to be mobile , this is a good laptop to sit on a desk .
target***When the buyer returned it Wal Mart just boxed it , taped it shut resold it as new .
target***I ordered four D620 laptops .
source***The dining room is quietly elegant with no music to shout over - how refreshing !
target***I have to keep turning it until it decides to lower and there is no mute .
target***The programs that come standard with the Leopard running system are enough for the average person to run all the basics .
source***Fish is so very fresh .
target***With all the programs that came with it , such as iLife and iWork , I was set from the very beginning .
target***got another 1 , and same issue .
source***The price was extremely reasonable for the appetizers and food we ate .
source***I plan on eating here more often .
target***We decided we would try to trade - in our old ones .
target***I love the feel of the key board , as well as the trackpad .
source***Hey , I think $ 2 + for a 5 block walk ai n't bad .
source***Great Indian food and the service is incredible .
target***I made a perfect decision when I bought the Toshiba !
source***The pizza was great .
source***Try the cheesecake !
source***I did n't expect to like Nosh as much as I did , but the pastrami on challah sandwich I had was otherworldly , the soups are like Mom 's , and the knishes give Yonah Schimmel 's a run for its money .
target***The lesson learned here is , It does not pay to by this loyal to any brand , since all of them are there to simply to make as much money as possible , as fast as they can , and in this day and age , the customer no longer is right all the times .
source***Really cool stauff inside .
source***Satisfying .
source***Always popular , always full , always a wait .
source***Our server was very helpful and friendly .
source***There is no excuse for such lousy service !
source***Over the years , it has always provided a pleasurable dining experience with quality food and wine .
source***The food is definitely good , but I left a bit disappointed .
source***We have never had any problems with charging the meal or the tip , and the food was delivered quickly , but we live only a few minutes walk from them .
source***Unique apppetizers .
source***The characters really make for an enjoyable experience .
target***I had the computer for a full year and it was a new computer .
source***by dinner time , they turn it around and mount a huge comeback ! !
source***They have a very diverse menu so its something for everybody .
target***I can not even read what I am writing half of the time .
target***I would never buy a Dell again .
target***Instead it is sitting in West Verginia waiting for UPS to take two days to send Me a box and Two days for them to ship the computer some 691 miles by air ? to Louisville Ky .
source***my personal favorite is an everything bagel with lox spread , but all the bagles are unbeliavably good .
source***I 'll keep this short .
target***Came fully loaded , good .
source***Any if you have a reservation you 'll wait for max 5 minutes , so have a drink at the bar .
target***It would not let me connect to my Wifi system where I lived .
source***Wo n't or Ca n't is not in the service directory .
target***Some days it 's just blurry , some days it appears that it 's raining on my nice desktop background of a lake and mountains .
target***All - in - all , I would definitely recommend this product for nearly everyone .
target***Still under warrenty so called Toshiba , no help at all .
target***Oh , it is such a great piece of equipment .
target***We used PC products , it seemed simpler to continue with the same thing .
target***I love the Apple products .
target***Would HIGHLY recommend this netbook though .
target***The price premium is a little much , but when you start looking at the features it is worth the added cash .
source***The place was nice and calm .
target***It allows me to do everything I need from a computer and more .
target***So I called customer support which is good too and they went through it and it is just a safety feature and it does not affect performance at all , I just chose to hide the message .
source***While the new restaurant still features much of the same classical furniture that made Tiffin so attractive , the menu has been overhauled .
target***Runs smooth and quick .
source***I liked this place the first time but doubt I will ever return .
target***I just bought this laptop 3 days ago .
source***Try the mediterranean salad , it is a true experience for your taste buds ! !
source***Get it together .
target***Web access through the 3 G network is so slow , it 's very frustrating and VERY DISAPPOINTING .
source***We ordered a tuna melt , it came with out cheese which just made it a tuna sandwich .
source***Be careful of portions , they 're HUGE .
source***Not only would I not recommend Jimmy 's restaurants to friends , I would strongly suggest they go anywhere but .
source***Is just the way it was in days gone by .
source***I knew upon visiting NYC that I wanted to try an orginal deli .
target***While I mostly use it for email , internet and gaming , I ' m confident all other applications live up to the high standard I ' ve come to appreciate from Mac laptops .
target***Those things are very important , vital even !
target***My real problem with it ? The statement of 7 hour battery life is not just mere exaggeration - it 's a lie .
source***The cream cheeses are out of this world and I love that coffee ! !
source***Too bad Latin Quarters closed .
target***The materials that came with the computer did not include the right # anywhere .
source***I have never before eaten 40 pieces of relatively good nigiri .
target***Applications respond immediately not like the tired MS applications .
target***While most people say that PCs hold functionality and value and Macs are just pretty to look at , I think there 's something to be said about the simplicity of Macs .
target***Taking it anywhere was a pain !
target***I was told by many that it was a great computer , but we got one of these , and it worked great for one year , and as soon as the warrenty was up , then it got really bad .
source***I have eaten at Saul , many times , the food is always consistently , outrageously good .
target***It WORKS !
target***All you have to do is turn it on and it works .
target***A longer battery life would have been great , but it meets it 's spec quite easily .
source***First the wrong bread came out with the appetizer , then when i tried to order a second glass of wine for my main course .
source***If you are in the area try The Bagel Shoppe on 74th street which is 3 blocks away on 2nd Ave .
target***It is extremely portable and easily connects to WIFI at the library and elsewhere .
source***Definitely will be back !
source***When asked about how a certain dish was prepared in comparison to a similar at other thai restaurants , he replied this is not Mcdonald 's , every place makes things differently While it is understandable that every place is indeed different , there was not a need to be uncourteous to customers and downright rude .
target***I was said it 's videocard .
target***NOW AM VERY APREHENSIVE ABOUT TOSHIBA LAPTOPS .
target***I just love this lap top , I just wish it were all silver or they had all black .
target***It is well worth the money it cost , Very good investment .
source***A great addition to Smith Street , finally , a place that 's not pretentious and filled with women wearing Ugg boots .
target***My laptop cost approximately $ 2,300 and DIED after only 2-years , 10-months and 18-days of use .
target***Enjoy that Toshib force and durability unparalleled
target***It was just one problem after another for me , and that 's reason we had forked out so much money was so we would n't have anything to worry about .
source***The all you can eat deal is truly amazing here .
source***All the NYU students love this place so it makes for a fun young atmosphere .
target***but other then that I would give this product a 4 in hafe stars .
source***The all - Italian staff is warm and engaging from the start .
source***The space is nice but when we order our drink we were in for a surprise .
source***My sister says it reminds her of a restaurant run by high - school students who do n't know what they are doing .
target***The quality , engineering design and warranty are superior -- covers damage from dropping the laptop .
target***My last laptop gave me a constant battle even though it was also completely new .
target***It 's applications are terrific , including the replacements for Microsoft office .
target***There are so many things wrong with this product , it just makes me want to set my self on fire !
target***and if u did .
source***The tastes makes your mouth water for more .
source***You rarely have to wait for a seat and the currys ( masaman , green , red ) are full of flavor and come super spicy if you ask for it .
target***In due course , I 'll remove the hard disc from this new MacBook Pro and dump it where it belongs , in the trash .
source***Pricey , but worth a try , at least once .
source***For appetizers , I recommend the shrimp fritters and dumplings .
source***For some reason the place was empty when we got in and remained so for the entire evening , I do n't understand why but we had a blast and will definately go back the next time we are in the area .
target***and the multiple page viewer allows you to press one button to see every separate page currently opened at the same time in one screen are great for those who are working non stop or just shopping online .
source***This place has the best interior I have seen anywhere in the northside of W'burg , and will impress whoever you bring there .
source***I was very impressed by this low - key upper eastsider and their authentically thai cuisine ! ! !
source***please do n't fool us .
target***This was purchased for my daughter and I was pleasantly surprised .
target***You may need to special order a bag .
target***/ awesome cooling system much better grafics card ATI 5870 / 8 GB RAM LED backlit screen .
target***The ease in which you set everything up is such that a child could do it .
source***I went to Areo on a Sunday afternoon with four of my girlfriends , and spent three enjoyable hours there .
source***My husband said the portions were very small , but if my main course was good to eat the portion would ' ve been fine for me .
target***Would do business again .
source***The filet mignon dish was superb !
target***bought the first asus laptop in san francisco , returned it in santa maria , thinking it was just a problem with that computer .
source***Nothing better than buying a snapple for $ 325 too .
target***The one thing I wish it had was a detailed hardcopy manuel .
target***When I got it , I immediately noticed that it was quite heavy and thick and not really attractive .
source***Interior was so so .
source***I am amazed by the poor reviews I find this place to be standout Italian in an area flooded with Italian great prices , great atmosphere , good service and a wonderful wine list .
source***The ambience was so fun , and the prices were great , on top of the fact that the food was really tasty .
target***When you look at the specs on Apple products in comparison to a Dell or a HP , yes they do seem to offer less for a higher cost .
source***Toons has recently been redone , so it 's now a very attractive space .
target***This laptop has left me with a HORRIBLE taste in my mouth for Acer brand products .
source***The shrimp scampi was excellent and the antipasti were plentiful .
target***Prior to this computer , I owned a PowerBook G4 for 6 years quite a long time for a laptop .
target***I also love the design , the looks , the feel , and the my toshiba feature is wonderfull .
target***Easy to start up and does not overheat as much as other laptops .
source***And evaluated on those terms Pastis is simply wonderful .
target***It was weird .
source***you guys rock .
source***we decided to eat in tea room which was small and cute .
source***But that is highly forgivable .
source***Downstairs lounge is always a good attraction
source***The dinner menu is diverse and top - notch as well .
target***Now for the hardware problems .
target***I fine Apple MC373LL / A 266GHz 15 Macboook Pro Notebook meets all my needs for a laptop computer when on the go .
source***Patroon features a nice cigar bar and has great staff .
target***This was an update from an early MacBook Pro .
source***Do n't be fooled by crowds of people .
source***I need at least three rolls to be full , and that 's at least $ 1400 ! .
source***The portions are now very small , the sauces are overly - ambitious usually inedible while the service is still good , the restaurant , due to its popularity , seems frantic .
target***I wish Toshiba would allow their customers to select an option that only boots the OS at setup and removes all the unnecessary stuff .
target***Again , I sent it off to Acer , by this time they were paying for me to send it to them and everything , but it was still inconvienent because of my classes and my communication with my fiance .
source***Otherwise , this place has great service and prices and a nice friendly atmosphere .
target***That 's a huge difference .
source***Saul is the best restaurant on Smith Street and in Brooklyn .
source***Orsay , is without a doubt one of the best values for authentic French food in NYC .
source***The ambience is authentic and relaxing and we have always received attentive and prompt service .
target***The computer would not ever cut back on .
target***If you could stretch by a few 100 dollars I highly recommend you should replace your Windows laptop with this one .
source***When I visited my friend who lives in the Upper Eastside , she recommended that we go to this restaurant .
target***this one , in my opinion , might be a lemon !
target***I contacted Acer and they are giving me FREE recovery DVDs , so do n't go and pay for them , just ask for them and they should give them to you .
source***My first time there I happened not to like the Crab Croquette apt that i ordered and they were happy to change it for me without making no big deal .
source***But the pizza is way to expensive .
source***Of course the reason its so packed is because the food is so delicious !
source***Yeah , sometimes the service can be slow .
source***When we walked in it seemed like it was there for 200 years .
target***Just what the doctor ordered .
target***I spent 2200 dollars on a top of the line laptop .
source***We could not catch our waiter 's eye , and he ignored us .
target***Sure hope Best Buy will replace it asap .
target***My main reason to convert was the imovie program .
source***I could have drank 4 glasses of water and still been parched , so watch out .
target***I highly recommend that you buy this product .
source***This is a great Thai restaurant with a very friendly staff .
source***But on a lazy Saturday night , we ended up going .
source***The fries are yummy .
target***I always have used a tower home PC and jumped to the laptop and have been very satisfied with its performance .
source***Both the fresh mozzerella slices and the Plain Cheese slice are phenomenal .
target***It 's outstanding too .
source***I would highly recommend this place !
source***The drinks are always welll made and wine selection is fairly priced .
source***Authentic Shanghai style and I can not recommend a better Shanghai place in New York .
target***But the screen size is not that bad for email and web browsing .
target***Got this for a graduation gift for my daughter for her to use at college .
source***After my 3rd time the manager remembered me and treated me like an usual customer .
target***It does n't have a lot of frills , but I did n't need any , and being able to buy what I needed , and not more than I needed was very important .
source***All pretty good .
source***I recommend the garlic shrimp , okra ( bindi ) , and anything with lamb .
source***The best burger I have had in the Village .
target***Overall , it 's ok .
source***My wife and I were in NYC celebrating our 30th anniversary .
source***However , I was there for a work dinner not long ago when my colleague from London noticed a very large waterbug on the ceiling .
source***We were worried we would have trouble getting in , but somehow managed to have a short wait .
source***They refuse to seat parties of 3 or more on weekends .
source***I suspect this restaurant is what Rao 's would be if it had n't turned exclusive .
target***The Genius at the Apple store advised me that there was nothing about my use of the computer that caused this failure .
target***It is easy to use , its keyboard easily accommodates large hands , and its weight is fantasic .
source***The ambience is pretty and nice for conversation , so a casual lunch here would probably be best .
source***Needless to say , I ' m never going back and you should be wary too .
target***Before we got this laptop , had a compaq pasaro for 5 years with no problems .
source***The strong scents coming from the left and right of me negatively affected my taste buds .
target***I love it !
target***It was still working , but there was nothing on the screen .
source***I have n't eat a lamb chop as delicious as that , the salads are really nice dressed with lemon and extra virgnin olive oil .
target***This is still a fairly good upgrade to a laptop that was about 4 years old .
target***on the bright side at least I was n't without my laptop for long this time !
target***3 weeks went by and the computer keeps crashing and will not open any applications .
source***The food is usually good but it certainly is n't a relaxing place to go .
source***And I hate to say this but I doubt I 'll ever go back .
source***$ 6 and there is much tasty food , all of it fresh and continually refilled .
target***what an elegant , wonderful machine .
target***They sent it back with a huge crack in it and it still did n't work .
target***Features like the font are very block - like and old school .
target***Very small and portable I ' ve had this netbook about 12 hrs now and It 's better than expected .
source***We were still sitting at the bar while we drank the sangria , but facing away from the bar when we turned back around , the $ 2 was gone the people next to us said the bar took it .
target***My favorite part of this computer is that it has a vga port so I can connect it to a bigger screen .
target***I would totally recommend any other laptop over this pile of grabage .
source***I tend to judge a sushi restaurant by its sea urchin , which was heavenly at sushi rose .
target***It is a REAL touchpad , not the toy I saw in other brands .
target***For those old enough to remember , it is similar to Beta versus VHS .
target***It 's super fast and a great value for the price !
source***We made early dinner reservations and were thoroughly impressed , reminds me of my grandfather , its old school Italian scenery with lots of fun stuff to admire .
source***And that 's no mean feat .
source***The cuisine from what I ' ve gathered is authentic Taiwanese , though its very different from what I ' ve been accustomed to in Taipei .
source***The food was bland oily .
source***While this is a pretty place in that overly cute French way , the food was insultingly horrible .
source***The service is always bad though , do n't expect much of anything from your server , and I would not recommend bringing a date here either .
source***Best Italian food I ever had and being Italian , that means alot .
target***We love the size of the screen , although it is still lightweight and very easy to tote around .
target***I love to write and play with graphics and html programming and my new Toshiba works great on both !
target***You will love this macbook if you choose to buy it .
source***And at the conclusion of this culinary nightmare the check was given to our table by knocking over a glass of water .
source***Try the sea bass .
target***It 's solid .
target***Have returned that laptop unused .
source***Delicious food , excellent service , and a pretty atmosphere make this a great choice for dinner and the $ 599 lunch buffet makes it an even better choice for lunch ! .
target***I ' m learning the finger options for the mousepad that allow for quicker browsing of web pages .
source***As a long - time patron of Mamoun 's , I always figured that I had found the best late night food spot in the city .
source***On the other hand , if you are not fooled easily , you will find hundreds of restaurants that will give you service and ambiance that is on par with Alain Ducasse , and food that will outshine in presentaion , taste , choice , quality and quantity .
source***The food was delicious , the atmosphere was relaxed , and we have now adopted Plate 347 as our Secret on Second !
target***iPhotos is an excellent program for storing and organizing photos .
target***It 's face and depanable .
target***Good price .
target***when i first got it i thought the size of it was a joke .
source***Do yourself a favor and walk the extra avenue from joe 's to eat here .
target***I do n't understand how anyone can think this is a great product worth purchasing .
target***first i have been searching for long time before i decided to get mac .
target***I am able to organize my pics , music and files easily .
source***Killer Sushi !
source***The staff has been nice , but they seemed really stressed and the unisex bathroom needs to be cleaned more often .
target***This was the 3rd day and part still had not been shipped .
target***There is no need to open a program first and the cliick open or import .
target***It seems to be incompatible with everything else .
source***The food was authentic .
source***The service was attentive without being overbearing and each dish we tried was wonderful from the spring rolls to the cod with pineapple tempura .
target***They transfer you around to other people who do not understand what you are saying and you ca n't understand what they are saying .
target***I can not even imaging going back to a PC after using this wonderful computer .
target***GREAT INVESTMENT !
source***Always ask the bartender for the SEASONAL beer ! ! !
target***The software is amazing .
target***I have had laptops in the past and I thought why not give these small netbooks a try .
target***For my burn thigh which has put a permanent mark on my skin it happened 7 months ago they offered me an ITouch 8Gig you know it is a bit insulating when a company this rich , offer a loyal customer like me , a bottom of their product line as a gift for events like this .
source***Kind , attentive wait staff .
target***I was taught to use Photoshop and was amazed .
target***After replacing the hard drive the battery stopped working 3 months of use which was frustrating .
target***It is always reliable , never bugged and responds well .
target***Despite the claims of the Apple apologists a vice of which I am recently myself reformed the internals of Mac laptops are NO different from PCs at this point .
target***Now that I have it I see that I really needed this for much more .
target***Also , I have had alot of trouble with the keys sticking and will not type correctly .
source***and I have eaten my share Which impresses me for having such a large amount of people to serve .
target***WOULD PAY MORE FOR IT IF I HAD TOO !
source***The food at this place is ' gourmet ' Indian cuisine .
target***Its also FUN to use !
target***I will never complain about the price since I believe you get what you pay for and my MacBook Pro was worth every dollar .
source***Less More in their case .
target***All of the programs Keynote , Pages , Numbers have an option to save your documents as Microsoft compatible , which really eliminates the need for the actual .
target***I love my Samsung TV and Galaxy S smartphone , but this Netbook was a very poor computer .
target***The difference is it 's a whole lot of fun using the laptop now , still learning the Apple navigation , but is fun and comes with a lot of cool apps .
target***You may be reading one now !
source***The location and ambience is Ok but the food is what makes up for it .
source***The sandwhiches are out - of - this world !
target***One drawback I noticed was sound quality via USB .
source***The service is not consistently excellent - just decent .
source***With the exception of our lemon salad that had so much pepper on it that our eyes started watering , the food here was decent , not great .
source***I will go back to Suan soon !
source***A bit breezy up there on the mezzanine from the wind coming from the tracks .
source***The Bagels have an outstanding taste with a terrific texture , both chewy yet not gummy .
source***But who says Murray 's is anything about service .
source***The combination of fresh tomato sauce , fresh mozz cheese , basil and the dough they make with imported flour , makes this is one of the better pizza 's in NY .
source***The atmosphere is much better than Sripraphai more modern and sleek .
target***I use it now more than I even thought I would .
target***Thank you Best Buy for putting my computer together and installing my first software , you guys were GREAT too !
target***You can call HP and they want you to buy more software to fix it .
source***Good food at the restaurant a bit expensive , but great if you want to impress your date .
target***It is just slow slow slow .
target***I do n't do any high tech stuff on it , just write papers , check mail , and sometimes play games , so I ca n't reccomend it if you are in the computer field .
target***I especially like the backlit keyboard .
source***It was raining , and we figured why not ?
target***Overall , this laptop is definitely a keeper with its simple yet stylish design and its array of fantastic colors to choose from .
target***It 's catatonic .
target***However , this will be my last as well .
source***But trust me it is so worth it .
target***The little battery that it did have would only last about an hour while just having it on the desktop .
target***I am first time Mac Buyer and am amazed at features and ease of use the Mac offers .
target***It took several weeks just to get them to acknowledge that I owned the warranty .
target***Also consider the MS Office apps are all trial versions , hope you have your own copies .
target***Best Buy Rocks !
source***No dress codes , no attitudes , plenty of comfort companionship , a great place to relax in an always busy Midtown .
target***I am using the external speaker sound is good .
source***Overall A oh ya even though there is waiting it is deff worth it
target***As a user of a PC , I will will admit that the macBook Pro has a better running system in which I found myself Getting the job done quicker .
target***Ok first .
target***I previously purchased a 13 macbook had pro specs and was aluminum style which had a nvidia 9800 If I am not mistaken and it had major heating issues .
source***If you 're looking for a great meal at a decent price , go to Del Frisco 's !
source***This quaint and romantic trattoria is at the top of my Manhattan restaurant list .
target***Again , decent comp for the price , and I was in need of one quickly as my other laptop died on me .
target***Laptops are usually used on the go , so why not give you a better battery ?
target***After 5 months of failed repairs , requested a full refund but was refused and it still is not repaired and Acer is indifferent to the issue .
source***While Sapphire is certainly not lacking in ambiance , and probably has the best decor of any Indian restaurant I have been to in New York City , the food was not what I had hoped for .
source***Cute place , nice wait staff but would never go there again .
source***I do suggest to ask to be seated upstairs if you are looking to be a little cozy .
source***The portions are small but being that the food was so good makes up for that .
source***With so many poor experiences to be had in the theater district , is truly an excellent find !
source***The chicken parm was edible but had canned tomato sauce and boxed pasta and the chicken with portobello mushrooms consisted of dry , inedible chicken with terrible sauce .
source***All my co - workers were amazed at how small the dish was .
source***The counter service is bad .
target***If you are looking for something reliable , this is the laptop for you .
source***I highly recommend the restaurant based on our experience last night .
source***Our family never expected such incredible entertainment in a restaurant .
source***If I wanted to deal with a crappy scene and annoying customers I 'd go out in Manhattan .
target***Great overall .
source***There is a lot of variety even for people who eat vegetarian like me .
source***We parked on the block of Nina 's the place looked nice , with people obviously enjoying their pizzas .
source***And the prices were way to high for what you get .
source***Even upon delivery , their juicy pork buns are quite good .
target***The speed is incredible and I am more than satisfied .
target***Even out of warranty !
target***I love this product because it is Toshiba and its 156 .
target***Price and purpose is awesome !
source***We both opted for a pasta dish and they were served timely and fresh .
source***Three of us arrived for dinner about 5 , 30 on a week night without reservations .
source***The wait staff is very freindly , they make it feel like you 're eating in a freindly little european town .
target***I love the dock where I can simply drop a file ontop of a particular program , and the program will simply open that file .
source***My fiance took me to Scopa last week for my birthday and I could n't believe the food .
source***They would n't even let me finish my glass of wine before offering another .
source***Over the years the host , Vittorio , and his crew , have always treated me as family -- although with all the business this not - so - little gem does , it amazing he 's even able to remember a consistent but not - so - frequent visitor .
target***Love the speed , especially !
target***The downside to this netbook is pretty much the same for any netbook , screen size is not something I 'd stare at for the entire 10 - 11 hours of battery life five days a week .
target***The wheel that turns the volume up and down does n't work in real time .
target***Actually , I had noticed the one on the sales floor also did n't have sound !
source***My GF and I still choose to eat there a lot because of diverse cocktails , the chill decor , and the decent sushi .
source***The desserts are more appealing then stuffy overpriced French restaurants .
target***The only thing I wish this had was the option to turn off the touchpad with a button like my big 16 laptop does .
target***My MacBook is probably the best investment I have ever made .
target***In fact , somehow and I never opened it up some specks of dust or something got inside the screen and are now there permanently , behind the front of the screen , in the way of the display .
source***The entire dining experience was wonderful !
source***We love the food , drinks , and atmosphere !
target***Very annoying .
source***But I 'd go back
source***You 'll adore it .
target***The processor is very quick and effective as I load webpages and applications .
target***Unfortunately , Apple 's quality has continued to slide .
target***Looking online , many people are having the same problem .
target***, -If you buy this , do n't go into it expecting 7 hrs of battery life , and you 'll be perfectly satisfied .
source***I have to say that if this what makes it easier to get a saet a lunch I do n't mind .
target***Sorry , newegg .
source***I ca n't believe people complain about no cheese sticks ?
target***The pricing is very competitive .
target***I had in the past a Dell laptop and they sent me the items it needed or they sent a repair technician to my house to fix it .
target***I visited the Apple Store and was impressed with the 17-inch MacBook Pro .
source***Personal pans are the perfect size for those hungry nights .
target***I asked how they would determine that since there are no scratches , dents or other signs of damage and was told that was the only way this type of damage could happen .
source***Based on a visit a month ago , I returned the week before Christmas and was hugely disappointed .
source***would have rather tried terrace in the sky or water club for that price
target***ANd I babyed the heck out of it just one day when i opened it turned it on went to click and it was broke .
target***The flaws are , this computer is not for computer gamers because of the OS X .
target***Thanks , MacConnection , for making this a seamless purchase !
source***The food was just OK , at least for what food was available .
target***The only problem is a lack of screen resolutions !
target***Which I still use and have hooked up to my TV .
source***We were n't !
target***I pondered very long over this decision .
target***I had a USB connect but , i ca n't use it because it is not compatible .
target***When it come time for warranty service to Toshiba you do n't matter .
source***honestly the worst sushi my husband and i had in our entire lives .
source***Still , try it once , since if you end up loving the food , it could be one of your best dining experiences .
target***It 's priced very reasonable and works very well right out of the box .
source***I love this cozy around the way Rest .
target***Keyboard is plastic and spongey feeling .
target***This is a great machine !
source***My entree of hot pot with seafood was full of imitation crabmeat with a couple pieces of shrimp and squid , and was unnecessarily heated with a burner .
source***Their coffee is quite good too !
source***THE MOST FUN RESTAURANT I HAVE EVER BEEN TOO !
source***We all had the tasting menu and unlike some of the other reviews , I felt there was more than enough food .
source***Service was excellent , and the AC worked very well too thank God , it was hot ! .
target***At least those computers did n't just die on me like this one .
target***the i3 processor does n't seem to run hot and the fan rarely turns on .
source***This is where the aforementioned line was .
target***I also tried the touch pad and compared it to other netbooks in the store .
target***I even got my teenage son one , because of the features that it offers , like , iChat , Photobooth , garage band and more !
source***Again , if you are in this neighborhood , by all means , come here .
source***Its an excellent place to relax and the food is one of the best in the city of New York .
target***Sound card is limited though .
target***The DVD drive randomly pops open when it is in my backpack as well , which is annoying .
target***Maybe it 's Acer , maybe it 's MSFT .
target***I ' m already hooked on the sleek look and dependability that this laptop has shown .
target***they had to replace the motherboard in April
source***Well , their deliveries take for ever and the food is usually cold .
target***Also , I issued a replacement RMA for a few dead pixels in the upper zone of the screen , which is noticable to me .
target***On my PowerBook G4 I would never use the trackpad I would use an external mouse because I did n't like the trackpad .
target***Oh and it has word and stuff but its a trial verion so after about a month or so when you go to open it it asks for a product key which did n't come with the computer and even after clicking cancel it wo nt let you use it at all I use the old word processer which works good .
target***I took it back for an Asus and same thing blue screen which required me to remove the battery to reset .
target***The machine has a bluray player the book has no mention of it or how to connect it to your HDTV .
source***Maybe I say so because it looked promising for people who like artery - clogging jewish deli food , but turns out to be poorly run and awful .
target***Runs fast and the regular layout keyboard is so much better .
source***Some servers make you feel like they are doing you a favor to bring you the food .
source***Good , dark atmosphere and the music is a nice touch .
target***I have had to take it to the geek squad guys to get it fixed because it has had viruses 3 times and i have not even had it for more then 4 months !
target***For the same price , you get a lot more in the Asus1920x1080 res .
source***Have been dozens of times and never failed to enjoy the experience .
target***So in late March , early April 2009 I was without it again for a couple weeks while I had online courses I had to complete and my fiance was in Afghanistan and web conferencing was the best communication method we had .
source***One of the more authentic Shanghainese restaurants in the US definitely the best in Manhattan Chinatown .
source***Service has always been friendly and efficient .
source***Guess the 555Soul ads did n't launch her big modeling career .
source***I had a huge group for my birthday and we were well taken care of .
source***The hostess and the waitress were incredibly rude and did everything they could to rush us out .
target***Do n't waste your money !
target***I looked at the computer and it said updating but the asked for a product key .
target***They sent out a Sony ' Certified ' technician .
source***It was huge , delicious , fresh , and will be the reason we return .
target***It was n't worth it .
source***After dealing with subpar pizza all over the Kensington neighborhood , I ' ve found little toninos .
source***Okay - i do n't mind the oily part cause most are cooked that way but it was way too bland .
target***He LEFT ME , instructions on what to do when this comes up , or that comes up .
source***just got back from lunch at Tamarind and it was excellent .
target***I think it was seventy nine plus tax .
source***Just an odd group .
target***However the frozen screens kept happening .
target***believe me apple has a reputation .
source***To me it exemplifies Soho , cute , artsy , interesting .
target***Winters is on it 's way and I imagine it will be cozy .
source***The puke green walls leave a lot to be desired , but the food is very good .
target***I had read online that some users were having sound problems .
source***You will not be disapointed at all .
target***I can render AVCHD movies with little effort , which was a problem for most pc 's unless you had a quad core I7 .
source***Ballato 's is consistently delicious authentic italian food .
source***First of all , this place is * not * romantic , as claimed by Citysearch 's editorial review .
source***It 's convenient .
target***The battery never held a charge longer than one hour and within two months , stopped holding a charge for more than ten minutes .
source***From the incredible food , to the warm atmosphere , to the friendly service , this downtown neighborhood spot does n't miss a beat .
source***Yet paired with such rude service , would never recommend for anyone interested in carrying any kind of conversation while there .
target***I Contacted HP about this situation and was given excuses , without results .
target***If internet connectivity is important I would recommend going with a dell net book for 50 bucks more , or buy a USB wireless card .
target***GET THIS COMPUTER FOR PORTABILITY AND FAST PROCESSING ! ! !
source***If you are the type of person who likes being scared and entertained , this is a great place to go and eat .
source***Katz 's deli is a great NY experience .
target***One , owning a mac is essentially a full production studio in the case of a mac book a portable version .
source***We concluded with tiramisu chocolate cake , both were delicious .
target***They break down just as often as PCs do , and the only reason they do n't get viruses , is because no one makes viruses for them , they 're not better in any way , they are worse , try finding virus protection programs for a Mac , they do n't exist .
source***Very popular style Izakaya Sake and small portion of sake - friendly dishes .
source***I always get the Shabu - Shabu dinner and the beef is always fresh .
source***It 's really also the service , is good and the waiters are friendly .
target***I am ADDICTED to photo booth !
target***Otherwise , all other features are a 1
target***I ' m still within the one year warranty but the repair " depot " has deemed that this time it was caused by physical abuse and is not covered .
source***THE BIG COMPLAINT , NO TOASTING AVAILABLE .
target***So glad I decided to upgrade !
source***They treat me like family , morning and night .
source***Slightly on the pricey side but worth it !
target***Of course , eMachines can not be made entirely to blame for this computer 's woes ;
target***The Internet Explorer was very slow from the very beginning .
target***I was tired of going without my laptop every few weeks .
source***The wait here is long for dim sum , but if you do n't like sharing tables or if the typical raucous dim sum atmosphere is not your gig , this is a sleek for Chinatown alternative .
target***This is something i would deffinately reccomend to someone .
target***LOVE THIS LAPTOP WONDERFUL PRICE FOR WHAT YOU GET !
target***I recommend for word processing and internet users .
target***I Love my new computer !
target***It takes me approximately 3 tries to get to each site , then after closing the browser and reopening it it actually works .
target***I ' m extremely happy with my purchase as I now have the portable power I have been looking for .
source***For authentic Thai food , look no further than Toons .
target***I ' ve had this laptop for about a month now .
source***We spent $ 200 in this place and left hungry and very disappointed .
target***They 're absolutely useless , unless you count the joy of releasing anger while smashing into little peices against the wall .
target***I personally like the gaming look but needed a machine that delivered gaming performance while still looking professional in front of my customers .
source***It is run by the same Sichuan chef who started the chain in Chinatown .
source***Stay far away from this place .
target***Its Office compatible , but the features and its functioning is all new again so you might as well save the money and just learn the pre installed mac programs .
target***The new Macbook Pro 15 inch i7 is nothing short of amazing .
source***It 's definately not a place to go if you want to impress someone .
target***The first one I had was a 2006 model , not the Pro .
target***The people are frustrating to work with , the product itself is very cheaply made , and the accessories are less than satisfactory .
target***As with any laptop not purchased with software options , it comes with a lot of what I consider useless applications .
source***As we were leaving , the couple standing by the door said to another waiter , we 're not in a hurry .
target***however , they were kind enough to send a replacement free of charge .
target***This computer was so challenging to carry and handle .
source***Small servings for main entree , i had salmon was nt impressed girlfriend had chicken , it was good .
source***Romantic if you want it to be brightly lit .
source***We had reservations at 9 pm , but was not seated until 10 , 15pm .
target***The Dell mini was the first Dell product that I had ever purchased .
source***The atmosphere is nothing special , but it feels like a Sushi establishment in Tokyo .
source***The food is very averagethe Thai fusion stuff is a bit too sweet , every thing they serve is too sweet here .
source***Good , because hey , it 's more food , but bad because dim sum is supposed to be smaller portions so you can try out more dishes and smaller so that each dish is cheap .
source***I take all my NYC guests to VT 's .
target***Great laptop for school , easy to use for beginners in the hoASPECT0hold .
target***You can even run a parallels type program easily and run any leftover PC software that you absolutely can not be without .
target***It is sleek and lightweight and charges quickly when needed .
target***this computer will last you at least 7 years , that s an amazing life spanned an electronic .
source***No apologies during restaurant week .
target***Three weeks after I bought the netbook , the screen quit working .
target***Highly recommended !
source***Great value for the quality ingredients .
target***English must have been his third or fourth language .
source***They pray to their Food Gods to make them into a good pizza like VT 's .
source***I have been urged by friends for months to check out the mermaid inn .
target***Finally , I purchased a Toshiba .
source***They had scrapped the bottom of the vessel in which they make the rice -RESULT , WE HAD LARGE CHUNKS OF BURNT RICE IN OUR SERVING BOWL .
source***The atmosphere is n't the greatest , but I suppose that 's how they keep the prices down .
target***This was my first MacBook purchase ever .
source***We were sorry to check them off our list as we had enjoyed and recommended the place in the past .
target***Those moments in thime where you want to throw something against the wall ? Yeah , I wanted to throw that lap top out the window and light it on fire .
target***OS X is solid with lots of innovations such as quicklook which save heaps of time .
source***strike up a conversation with the attorney next to you , or with the local union worker on the other side .
target***Reason why ? It 's because when you buy it , you know first thing that you will not lose any value for that laptop , the price will stay the same for the next year , and even if Apple does decides to change mode , your laptop value will only drop 10 - 20 % , unlike PC laptops which drop more than 80 % .
source***Fresh , authentic , french cuisine in substantial portions .
source***The sake menu should not be overlooked !
target***This is n't a big deal , I have n't noticed the issue with DVDs or other media , only through USB output .
target***The shop will definitely push the problem to the service center .
source***I recommend the meatballs and caprese salad and the beans on toast were a wonderful start to the meal !
source***we came here on a crowded saturday night and were seated right away despite being 15 minutes late for our reservation .
source***After dinner , take your date to the HUGE dance floor , probably one of the biggest you 'll see in NY .
target***Another Great thing is the Beast graphics .
source***Ambiance and music funky , which I enjoy .
source***The music is the best among all the Indian restaurants I have visited .
target***I would like to tell you about the best laptop I just got from Mac .
target***Bought this gateway M-50 or 150 early 2007 .
source***Not pretentious and very economical .
target***although its windows vista compared to windows xp sucks .
source***They were served warm and had a soft fluffy interior .
target***Hopefully Amazon will take this back .
target***I got what I paid for .
target***It 's a joke .
target***I have had the netbook for 2 months and I love it , I read some reviews that say netbooks are slow but it does not seem any slower than the other computers I use .
source***We go often .
source***All we received was an apology as we left to see our show without dinner .
source***Filled with suits , though , so you never really feel terribly comfortable .
target***He said quite a number of people had encountered this problem and said it is a common issue .
source***otherwise , good stuff for late nite eats .
target***I should have checked this before I installed my applications .
target***I am going to go back and return at Store I bought from !
source***The service is a little scatty at times but all is forgiven when the food arrives .
target***I recently purchased the mini and absolutely love it !
source***If you 're not familiar with the cuisine , you may encounter problems ordering here and be sure to bring plenty of cash with you as they do n't accept credit cards .
target***Not good for a person who gets online daily .
target***I had a MacBook Notebook , and it had absolutely no protection from viruses , spyware , malware , etc .
target***From the second you open the box you will fall in love with this computer !
source***A million better places to go in the city .
target***The battery life is amazing , the versitility is outstanding .
target***The battery does n't last long but I ' m sure an upgrade battery would solve that problem .
source***I would definitely recommend SEA if you like thai cuisine !
source***While certain staples are excellent the burger , some of the pastas , the food is not really the point .
source***Food is great and inexpensive .
target***I would like at least a 4 hr battery life .
target***I was WRONG !
source***I ca n't wait for summer , when they serve outside on their gigantic patio .
target***Few viruses to catch ;
target***-Called MacHouse Amsterdam to ask for a temporary replacement , no answer .
target***Loaded with bloatware .
source***Best drumsticks over rice and sour spicy soup in town !
target***HP did n't fix it .
target***I waited another month for approval and for them to BUILD me a new laptop .
source***The only friendly staff member was the guy at the bar .
target***In fact , he said , about 10 % of their products fail .
source***Please take my advice , go and try this place .
target***Not to mention sometimes the whole charger unit will decide not to work entirely .
source***I look forward to eating here again
target***I bought this laptop and found its TAB is not functioning .
source***Just straight up cheap , good food .
target***The Macbook arrived in a nice twin packing and sealed in the box , all the functions works great .
source***I have NEVER been disappointed in the Red Eye .
source***Ok , so the servers wander around a little clueless , but there 's more than enough servers for the crowd they get - it 's fine , you just have to make a small effort to get their attention .
target***She said Wal Mart rants and raves abouy carring Dell because it 's a big name but they are a piece of garbage .
target***The improvements to the OS have been relatively gradual , but substantive .
source***The staff is no nonsense .
source***The best thing I tasted were the lambchops .
target***I have had my MacBook for almost 6 months and can honestly say that I will NEVER buy another computer if it is not a Mac .
target***The Toshiba Satellite has been more than I expected for the price .
target***Ease of use is just one of the benefits I love about my Mac .
target***Before , I reloaded with Windows 7 Ultimate and used only the downloaded drivers from Acer 's site .
target***I respond that I do not have the old computer .
target***HP said I had done the damage .
target***It is easy to use and lightweight .
source***Spreads and toppings are great , though a bit pricey .
source***Not worth the prices .
source***The other night we had the $ 30 three course meal and everything was delicious , if I could of licked the plate clean I would of .
source***It can be a little confusing as to where one goes to order , but once the food is ordered , you are in for a treat .
source***Wonderful at holiday time .
target***My wireless provider confirmed my home internet is fine , and any connections I turn on should work .
target***I also travel with it and it never gives me any problems .
source***Recommendations , of course , are required !
target***so we got a good deal on hsn for an ascer notebook and we bought it for him .
target***This is a great little computer for the price .
source***Stumbled upon this gem of a pizza place and I will be going back frequently .
target***Numerous problems over the next 3 weeks until I got the blue screen of death and had to send the PC back to HP .
source***The menu has lots of options , I hope to go back to try those potato pancakes .
source***The table service could have been a little more attentive but as someone who also works in the service industry , I understood they were busy .
source***This is also where I was from .
source***I love this place !
source***It is not worth for that bucks .
source***It 's just OK pizza .
target***I just ca n't fathom that the celebrated Dell would last a week in environment of free competition with normal products , it only survives b / c its substandard laptops are forced onto captive students and employees through question - raising programs .
target***Went silently .
target***I bought this last week , and the very next day had to return it because it over heated and the touch - mouse stopped responding .
target***Did I mention everything about it , from size to weight to keyboard screams BULK ?
source***Decent wine selection too .
source***they were dry and disgusting , i did n't even finish my first piece .
target***The most amazing part to me as a PC user is the startup and shutdown times , and the fact that you very rarely have to restart the thing .
source***Most people eat there seem to be typical Upper East Side snobs , so be aware .
source***The waiters were not attentive except that the bill turned up on the table before we were finished .
target***Everything I have tried has worked and I never have to carry the wall charger cause the battery is so awesome .
source***It costs $ 2 extra to turn a regular roll into an inside - out roll , but the roll more than triples in size , and that 's not just from the rice .
source***For being number 1 , this place has alot of work to do in order to truly earn its so called reputation .
source***The cafe itself was really nice with comfortable outdoor chairs and tables , but the service could have been better .
source***In China the phrase for a good restaurant is hot and loud .
target***I would recommend not buying this product .
source***You can also special order any kind of dumpling , etc .
source***My friends spoke so much about it for months , I finally made the time to come down ear and dine in .
target***By week two , my laptop had overheated and was completely dead even though I did not use it too much .
source***Saturday , Nov 6th I had a group from work come in with about 35 people and the staff was amazing to accomodate us .
target***I took it home and within 30 min , it was freezing up and did the blue screen of death .
target***do not buy you will be disappointed .
target***All in all , I ' m incredibly dissatisfied with this laptop , and with HP as a whole .
source***If just to drop in , quickly stuff yourself and jet out - to keep their turn - over .
target***I had of course bought a 3 year warranty , so I sent it in to be replaced and almost 2 months later the dv4 is what the sent me as a replacement .
target***I bought this netbook for traveling , and it 's great , light , functional , and meets my needs .
source***Rao 's has the best service and atmosphere in NYC .
source***I also recommend the rice dishes or the different varieties of congee ( rice porridge ) .
target***So I called Compaq , and after being on the phone for 3 hours , i finally got a replacement which I should n't have had a problem getting since it was under warranty .
source***Sauce was watery and the food did n't have much flavor .
source***I was pretty much full after our fondue appetizer .
source***Immediately after we paid , the waiter took the money and said , okay , you guys are outta here .
source***It is obvious that no one in the restaurant has any idea about or experience with Japanese cuisine .
target***Yeah , to you .
target***Now I have the best of both worlds with all of the power and ease of the Mac !
target***I was originally concerned that I could n't view work I had done in college on my Mac because of the PC formatting , but I was even more thrilled to learn of programs like iLife and iWork that allow you to convert your PC documents into readable files on Macs .
source***The sushi seemed pretty fresh and was adequately proportioned .
source***It looked like shredded cheese partly done , still in strips .
target***And printing from either word processor is an adventure .
target***But after using it a couple of weeks , the overall operation is poor .
source***Be careful , when they say spicy , they mean it !
source***Not cheap , but not that expensive either .
source***And the bill was outragous .
source***Even though I made the reservation at 3 pm for the same night through Dinnerbroker , we were seated at a table with one of the best view !
source***There are many Thai places in the city but so far Toons is # 1 .
target***Fast , great visual !
target***The battery never held a charge longer than one hour and within two months , stopped holding a charge for more than ten minutes .
source***I was n't there for the Half - Price Saturday Night Special , but Tuesday Night .
source***in an effort to increase turnover , the restaurant offers no desserts beyond the complimentary espresso cup filled with chocolate mousse .
target***Could n't keep a page up you were working on !
source***A little pricey but it really hits the spot on a Sunday morning !
source***I would like to return and try some of the other menu items when I do n't have to rush off to a show .
source***I went here with my boyfriend and another couple .
source***What makes this restaurant special are the authentic sichuan cooking and being the only one in NYC that offers authentic chongqing hotpot .
source***Wonderful !
target***This worked just fine .
target***I am not sure if it was the drive itself , however ;
source***So if you want a nice , enjoyable meal at Montparnasse , go early for the pre - theater prix - fixe .
target***I had to call HP and ask for a recovery disk because the computer does not come with one and completely redo it all .
target***It is made better , thicker , and all out tough !
target***and it has blue screen crashed on me twice .
target***Had some trouble finding a case that it would fit in .
target***compresses itself and you ca n't use it .
target***The other lock - up problems are from a myriad of causes , the most common being a corrupted version of Appleworks which can render the browser useless .
source***love the food .
target***The internet was locekd and froze every time it was trying to be used , and the command prompt would not work at all .
target***Since I never really got to use this , I ca n't comment on anything except what went wrong after trying 2 of them .
target***I have recently converted back to a mac and I could n't be happier !
source***Somewhat pricey but what the heck .
source***It is so easy to get a reservation at a top place in NYC with a week 's notice .
source***Unlike other places in NYC where the sandwiches you want only come as a triple - decker , here you can get what you want in a reasonably - sized portion and price .
target***After about a week I finally got it back and was told that the motherboard had failed and so they installed a new motherboard .
source***For sure i will keep coming back because i feel really this restaurant deserves .
target***I do n't know how I could ever live without my Qousmio .
source***There is actually space to breathe and the decor sets the tone for an intimate dinner .
target***The reaction of Toshiba is there is nothing you can do about it so just sit back and except the fact that you are powerless and it is mind over matter .
target***High price tag , however .
source***Nice place though .
target***i have had my dell latitude for almost three years .
target***Both computers started acting extremely slow within the first year of owning them .
source***To dine at Thalia can be slightly deceiving because while its beautiful on the outside , its so bland on the inside .
target***It was returned on the third day I owned it .
source***Both times we waited well over a half hour for a table even though we had reservations .
source***It is also extremely well priced .
target***I ' m glad it waited , this one is great .
source***We ' ve been to Grocery three times and not once has an item on the menu disappointed .
target***u can do what u want in just few seconds , even to start up your computer takes few seconds .
target***My last computer , a Toshiba , cost only $ 400 , and worked like a charm for many years .
target***The extended warranty for the $ 4000 and up computers was the only one available for purchase on the drop drown menu .
target***Apparently they are defective since they are not securely attached .
target***So , I must say I am not a happy camper .
source***We walked in on a Wednesday night and were seated promptly .
source***it helps if you know what to order .
source***I HATE HATE HATE this place .
source***We go on Mondays for the prix fixe and our experience with the food has been comparable to Blue Ribbon .
source***We ' ve only eaten in the restaurant once , but we have ordered many times for dinner .
target***The battery life also does n't keep up with the claim but still I think macbook is much ahead from the rest of the pack .
target***My friends are in awe every time they come over !
target***It was very easy to just pick up and use It did not take long to get use to the Mac OS .
target***I have had to call with a few questions or issues and they have helped me for free , even without the warranty .
source***Being from the south , there are n't any good delis in my area and while watching Foods across America on PBS I found out about Katz 's Deli .
target***Trying to balance all of my roles leaves very little time for me to do anything , so I want to manage my time I do have to be the most efficient .
target***It 's not like I have used for half a year and then complained about it .
source***The portions are HUGE , so it might be good to order three things to split rather than one appetizer and entree per person for two people .
target***The screen is nice and the images comes very clear , the keyboard and the fit just feels right .
target***The only bad part is the size .
source***still stay away , the table next to us walked out after my table and aanother were serves eventhough they were there much longer .
target***They claim that I should be happy because I am getting a new laptop to replace my two - month old laptop .
source***Well worth the trip , close to City Hall and downtown subway stops .
target***Ease of use is just one of the benefits I love about my Mac .
source***The chicken pot pie is excpetiona , the cheeseburger huge and delictable , and the service professional wan warm .
source***I went with 5 friends and we lingered at the table for a bit and did n't feel rushed at all even though there was a wait .
source***The zucchini and mashed potatoes are a blend of garlic and butter which simply melts in your mouth .
target***I ' ve had friends with Acers who seem to have had similar or exact same problems .
source***The first time I went , and was completely taken by the live jazz band and atmosphere , I ordered the Lobster Cobb Salad .
source***I ' m not sure why these other reviewers are whining so much .
source***I have never had cheescake like this .
source***You ca n't say its cheap because food is cheaper in Chinatown .
source***This place would be so much better served by being run by a group that actually understands customer service .
source***my wife and i have been going to nyc for years and would n't miss roxy , s food is expensive but it 's new york !
source***They are amazing !
target***Very fast boot up and shut down .
target***Who could n't love a DVD burner , 80-gigabyte HD , and fairly new graphics chip ? As I soon discovered , though , there is a reason for which similarly - configured Sony and Toshiba machines cost more , they use higher - quality components that are faster , better - configured , and end up lasting a lot longer .
target***The touchpad is extremely sensitive , which is the only drawback .
target***The technical service for dell is so 3rd world it might as well not even bother .
target***Bought it to use mostly for oline classes .
target***another problem .
source***The lobster sandwich is good and the spaghetti with Scallops and Shrimp is great .
source***If your favorite Chinese food is General Tao chicken , then this is NOT your place .
target***It has a 10 hour battery life when you 're doing web browsing and word editing , making it perfect for the classroom or office , and in terms of gaming and movie playing it 'll have a battery life of just over 5 hours .
source***I would recommend Roxy 's for that , but not for their food .
source***Good crowd , good outdoor seating , with a hip japanese vibe .
target***HP said it was out of warranty .
source***Consistently good Japanese Tapas .
source***My son and his girlfriend both wanted cheeseburgers and they were huge !
source***I went there for lunch and it was not as good as I expected from the reviews I read .
source***The bread and lamb chops I had before the meal were quite good , however .
source***We ate outside at Haru 's Sake bar because Haru 's restaurant next door was overflowing .
source***Also , specify if you like your food spicy its rather bland if you do n't .
source***And comparing it to the Chinatown restaurants is simply not fair .
source***Tried the pad see ew on the recommendation of the last reviewer since it 's one of my favorite dishes .
source***I have been in many restaurants all over the city and Roth 's Steakhouse has quickly become one of my favorites .
source***The rice was poor quality and was cooked so badly it was hard .
source***Will absolutely visit again .
target***the hinge design forced you to place various connections all around the computer , left right and front .
target***Later it held zero charge and its replacement worked for less than three months .
target***This computer was awful !
source***They need a kick out of it but until then the sushi is pretty good and the place is consistent .
source***A glass of Leaping Lizard , a glass of prosecco , and the mussels had everything happy .
target***The Macbook Pro is extremely thin and light compared to those heavy Windows Laptop .
target***But I do n't see it as a problem .
source***I would not have been so disappointed with the portions if the qualities were good enough to make up for it , but they were not !
target***Do yourself a favor and invest in a few external harddrives if you are planning on purchasing this laptop .
source***When I saw that their website had a link to da Ciro in Napoli , I knew there was going to be good pizza !
target***It is meant to be PORTABLE .
target***They need to stop outsoucing and send some complaint calls to US based customer service agents for those who live in the United states .
source***even the wine by the glass was good .
source***I think that it is absolutely brilliant and well runned business operation .
target***I had a toshiba for 10 years .
source***The service was attentive , yet discreet .
target***Finally set the unit back to HP after a month of hell .
target***the internet can be an scary place its up to you on what you do with it .
target***I also bought one for my wife , and 3 for my office .
target***-When battery life went to 4 hours or less , took it to the MacHouse Amsterdam for repair 26th of August .
source***My friend ordered some of their special sushi rolls which had excellent presentation and tasted great !
source***We wo n't go to this place again for a good meal .
source***The service was attentive , yet unimposing , the food was far better than many notorious restaurants in Midtown and the wine list is extensive and well priced .
source***Their Margarita is best I ' ve had since I ' ve returned from Naples !
source***Great sushi experience .
source***Little Tonino 's is just awesome , our favorite delivery place in Kennsington , honestly the best Gnochi I have ever had !
target***Easy learning curve .
source***As for the bar , this is another bad idea .
target***this company truely does make horrible products and does nt seem to because they are certain things like this never happen .
source***This is the perfect spot for meeting friends , having lunch , dinner , pre - theatre or after - theatre drinks !
target***Somehow the system clock got messed up after reboot .
source***Perhaps the last reviewer who stated she was treated with attitude lives in a parallel universe because I have never had anything but a perfect experience at Yasuda .
target***Handles all my basic media needs easily .
source***It is by far my favorite restaurant in Brooklyn .
target***I picked it out becaASPECT0 it was inexpensive $ 400 and I thought it would be a good , easy to use first laptop .
source***I live nearby and when they first opened , I ate there a lot .
target***I am forever changed and will no longer buy a Windows based machine for personal use .
source***The Thai food is good .
target***There is a small red circle next to it with a x in the middle , and when I click on it it says , Consider replacing your battery and it does not hold full charge .
source***I ' ve rarely had a problem with slow staff in the 10 years I ' ve been going .
source***Good food .
source***this is the best secret place in midtown ' , I heard that from the bartender , after having brilliant food try steak with portobello mushrooms and drinks on the bar last Tuesday .
source***happy to be a regular at this place and would warmly recommend it to anyone .
target***i ' m returning mine
source***Our first time in New York and we had to try a New York Bagel .
source***You fellas above says its the best Taiwanese restaurant in town .
source***I have had so many dinners here and it 's always been perfect , on a date with my husband , with my mom , with girlfriends and larger groups .
target***Steve Jobs , probably needs help and donations , and can not afford a reasonable offers for people that truly are trying to support his baby .
target***The 17 inch screen is very large , but the computer is very light .
target***So far , so good .
target***They said it was a computer error on this type of computer .
source***Kudos Haru
target***All was well .
target***To this day , there are NONE .
target***Should be there by the end of the week again .
target***But , I would recommend this product .
source***I grew up on these bagels .
target***This Notebook restarts every time there is a new update , so if you do n't save your files and information , everything will be lost .
source***It 's a place for people who pay a lot for mediocre food , noise and a chance to be with their fellow bridge and tunnel folks .
source***No you 're going to go back because the food was good .
target***I saw walmart had the same computer for about $ 650 but still knowing what I know now , I would not buy it at that price .
target***The Apple MC371LL / A 24Ghz 154-inch MacBook Pro Notebook is a horrible waste of money .
target***The screen is n't huge , but that does n't matter when I output media to the 50 inch LCD TV .
source***But they do .
target***It is everything I 'd hoped it would be from a look and feel standpoint , but somehow a bit more sturdy .
source***Probably would not go again .
target***I hate to say this , but if I could take this back to the shop and get my money back , then I would .
target***The speakers are terrible and are probably the cheapest ones I have ever seen in a laptop so if your planning to listen to music I suggest you get something better .
target***Plus it is small and reasonably light so I can take it with me to and from work .
target***He loves it and it is easy to use and well the schools start teaching the kids early about computers so it was easy for him to get started .
target***I also purchased Applecare for $ 300 , which is a three year extended warranty , since I ve never seen any laptop that lasted more than two .
target***Bought for my daughter to take for starting college this fall , she has been on it non - stop ever since learning how to use it .
target***Wireless has not been a issue for me , like some others have meantioned .
source***Chance is a joke .
source***kalbi and nebbiolo do work together .
source***Much more reasonably priced too !
target***We both recently got new laptops .
source***We will come back ! ! !
source***If you want a casual neighborhood bistro that has great food and excellent service , this is the place .
target***The port is secured to motherboard so when this happens you ca n't see the plug at all , it 's just gone .
source***I got an excellent piece of cheesecake and we had several other nice pastries .
target**** is a bit laggy , not the greatest .
source***THE FRANKENSTEIN SHOW WAS THE BEST .
target***Its white color is stylish for college students and easy to take to carry and take to classes .
target***From the build quality to the performance , everything about it has been sub - par from what I would have expected from Apple .
source***This is the first time Citysearch did't call it right .
source***Their bagel are fine , but they are a little overcooked , and not really a special bagel experience .
target***It was over rated !
source***Had a late night dinner on a Saturday night .
source***Our agreed favorite is the orrechiete with sausage and chicken usually the waiters are kind enough to split the dish in half so you get to sample both meats .
target***Also , macbooks come with much more features which are so cool !
target***without a big ol clunky machine in my backpack , I feel like I can do programming homework anywhere .
source***It was pretty inexpensive too .
source***Authentic bistro !
target***Windows is also rather unsteady on its feet and is susceptible to many bugs .
target***I would recommend it just because of the internet speed probably because that s the only thing i really care about .
source***They showed up 15 minutes after the tuna melt .
target***I am totally satisfied with my little toshie !
source***I / we will never go back to this place again .
source***Instead of wasting your time here , SUPPORT RESTAURANTS THAT CARE ABOUT FOOD .
target***The magnetic plug - in power charging power cord is great I even put it to the test by accident excellent innovation !
target***If you are a PC user looking to convert I would HIGHLY recommend it !
target***I got the black MacBook two years ago and have never regretted it .
target***taking notes , research , an online class and such and did n't want to spend too much on my first machine .
target***With in weeks of purchasing my computer is began to slow down .
source***If you are in search of the most authentic NYC deli experience look no further than the famous and historic Katz 's Deli down on the Lower East Side .
target***So this review might be a tad bit bias .
target***I was n't really as concerned about portability it 's a very large laptop but it 's not hard to move around or take on a trip which was a pleasant surprise .
target***Additional caveat , the base installation comes with some Toshiba - specific software that may or may not be to a user 's liking .
target***We now own two of these , identical .
source***I was wrong .
target***There s a built in camera with special effects for video and photography .
source***highly recommended .
source***Best dish is nori - wrapped tuna .
target***After 4 days , being denied 6 times and told off once , I managed to get through and was able to send them a scanned copy of the receipt .
source***If you love seafood , you would love this place !
source***The food was exceptional .
source***It will be on my to do list the next visit to NYC .
target***So far , it 's an average laptop , no better , no worse than the HP I replaced .
source***Service was decent , but not as smooth as I would expect from a place with these prices and reputation .
source***The service is outstanding and my crab - cake eggs benedict could not have been better .
target***Dell wanted to charge us for everything everytime I called them with a problem .
target***not using wired lan not sure what that s about .
source***The Singapore Mai Fun had NO curry flavor whatsoever .
target***I acually believe the issue is with the Nvidia grafics card , but still requires a return .
target***PC users work in Word , while Mac users work in Pages .
target***It is easy to navigate and update programs .
source***I am not a vegetarian but , almost all the dishes were great .
source***The fish is fresh and each piece is sliced to perfection and seasoned by the sushi chef usually with a little fresh wasabi and soy sauce but also sometimes with some sea salt .
target***The battery life is great .
target***It was slow , locked up , and also had hardware replaced after only 2 months !
source***If you ' ve ever been along the river in Weehawken you have an idea of the top of view the chart house has to offer .
target***It makes sorting out all those photos on my digital camera a breeze , and organizing them by place , time taken , or sending them to an online print shop , or uploading them to Flickr or Facebook etc , is not hard at all .
source***Reasonable prices .
source***Old school meets New world .
source***The service was bad , the food took to forever to come , we sat on the upper level .
target***The body is a bit cheaply made so it will be interesting to see how long it holds up .
source***The decor is vibrant and eye - pleasing with several semi - private boths on the right side of the dining hall , which are great for a date .
source***In an area sadly lacking in decent Thai food , this is one of the best spots .
target***Save your money and go for a better device .
source***You ca n't go wrong with this place .
target***Battery life needs more life .
target***It has a 1 ghz faster processor and a stock 500 gb hard drive .
source***The flavors are great , and the menu is extensive .
target***Well I spilled something on it and they replaced it with this model , which gets hot and the battery does n't make it through 1 DVD .
source***Go there to relax and feel like your somewhere else .
source***If anyones has doubt of not knowing enough about wines , please check their wine list .
target***The graphics and screen are stunning and although I was a PC person , I was able to understand how to use a mac fairly quickly .
source***This is a cute place and could be good but they need to get their act together .
source***Food was very good , but not what I would consider out of this world .
target***It 's a great product for a great price !
target***Not to mention the fact that your mac comes fully loaded with all necessary basic programs .
source***Haru serves very fresh fish , has a trendy , modern ambiance , prime location on Park Avenue South and friendly service .
source***While this is n't classical restaurant fare , the chef has given new life to an old cuisine with some really innovative and tasty dishes that are genuinely Indian without being heavy or same old restaurant burn - outs .
source***You wo n't find that anywhere in Manhattan .
target***After a little more than a year of owning my MacBook Pro , the monitor has completely died .
source***The people in the restaurant were pretty obnoxious and loud .
source***A real dissapointment .
source***The food is outstanding and the service is quick , friendly and very professional .
source***No , really .
source***I came here with my boyfriend for our anniversary because it was highly recommended to him by a friend .
source***If you live in Upper Manhattan , Siam Square is THE place for Thia food .
source***As much as I like the food there , I ca n't bring myself to go back .
source***Went there and had a combination of different seafood dishes and appetizers .
target***Sometimes you really have to tap the pad to get it to worki
target***They also have a longer service life than other computers I have several friends who still use the older Apple PowerBooks .
target***Two times with in one month .
source***Fresh ingredients and everything is made to order .
source***I ve asked a cart attendant for a lotus leaf wrapped rice and she replied back rice and just walked away .
target***I ' m pretty sure it 's not newegg 's fault but when you turn on a computer you just bought you want it to at least get to desktop .
target***An absolutely hateful machine that no one should get of their own free will .
target***I BOUGHT THIS LAP TOP AND THE CHARGE TIME DOSE N'T LAST AS LONG AS THEY SAY IT WILL MORE LIKE 2 HOURS
source***overall , a solid restaurant and at less than $ 40pp including wine , a solid deal as well .
target***I am stuck with a laptop that I can not do very much with .
source***The food was very good , but not very thai .
target***It has easy to use features and all the speed and power I could ask for .
source***This place has many different styles of pizza and they are all amazing .
target***Perfect trifecta !
target***Good bye BLUE SCREEN and Critical errors ! ! ! !
target***From the get - go , the M6809 was unsteady in its operation ;
source***This food is asian - air fusion .
source***I went here with a friend on a whim , we went someplace else first and could n't get a table .
target***I am very Happy !
source***The eggplant parmesan is also great , and my friend who grew up in Manhattan claims that no one serves a better baked ziti with meatsauce .
target***I already own an iPhone , and so the move just made more sense .
target***I got the first Blue screen of death in the early part of July .
target***I have recommended this laptop to everyone I know who is buying one .
source***Once they ran out of Gnochi and made it for me from scratch !
source***The best pad thai i ' ve ever had .
source***My boyfriend and I went there to celebrate my birthday the other night and all I can say is that it was magnificent .
source***It is the type of place to run into old friends and have a late , raucus dinner .
target***After years of occasionally pulling my hair out fighting computer viruses , a good friend convinced me it was time to go the Apple route .
target***If that is the case for you , I would suggest a pull - behind solution when looking at cases .
source***My boyfriend and I recently had an early dinner at Artisanal and was satisfied with our experience .
target***It weighed like seven pounds or something like that .
target***Obviously we both got new Macs .
source***This dish is my favorite and I always get it when I go there and never get tired of it .
target***They told me to reprogram the computer , and I did n't need to do that , and I lost pictures of my oldests first 2 years of her life .
target***The first fell apart right after the 1-year - warranty .
source***The calamari comes with an incredible sauce , and the duck noodles are yummy as well .
source***Steamed fresh so brought hot hot hot to your table .
target***Took it back as it was defective .
source***I had their eggs benedict for brunch , which were the worst in my entire life , I tried removing the hollondaise sauce completely that was how failed it was .
target***I am a wife , mom and a school teacher and a college student .
target***After doing extensive research , macconnection had the lowest price on the 15 MBP i5 .
target***I did not take the class and wish that I would have .
target***It has come into good use for my finances , scheduling , my parents business expenses , and it is definitely amazing for gaming .
source***I must say the view of NYC is so beautiful !
target***The feel of this is better than the Toshiba , too .
target***It had the full sized touch pad with 2 buttons instead of just one .
target***this apple navigates you thru the unexplored world of the internet .
source***I wish they had one near my office I would go everyday .
target***My HP is very heavy .
target***Keyboard was also very nice and had a solid feel .
source***The New York Times has reviewed this place three times already , you know it 's going to be good .
source***I recommend ordering in on a weeknight .
source***My suggestion is to eat family style because you 'll want to try the other dishes .
source***Hurley 's is terrific !
source***Ahhh .
source***Prices are higher to dine in and their chicken tikka marsala is quite good .
target***With awesome graphics and assuring security , it 's perfect !
source***Their sake martini is wonderful .
target***After 3 pleasant weeks of use , the laptop just died .
target***This computer is the ideal college companion .
source***There are much better places in NY with better prices .
target***So needless to day , I ' m not happy .
source***Granted the space is smaller than most , it is the best service you will find in even the largest of restaurants .
target***All for such a great price .
target***Windows also shuts the computer down for no reason without warning .
target***At first it worked well for a month or so then the system board failed and I send it in to toshiba some complaints and three weeks later I then receive my laptop back only to discover that it still has the same problem so now I have to send it back again to get it fixed again .
source***I ' ve had pizza both times and the caprese salad appetizer .
target***The speed difference is next to NOTHING for a mac , and the hard drive can be manually upgraded or you could just buy a $ 60 500 gb external hard drive .
target***they will not let you down .
target***Besides the great look , it is a great machine .
source***The svc can be a bit rude at times , esp if you have big group , but overall the restaurant is a must !
target***they have not sent a new one nor called .
source***I guess the way my friends and I described it was The French Colonies .
source***Place should also have a 1,2,3 chili rating to be more authentic .
target***I tried giving it 0 stars but I had to choose at least one , but IMO NO STARS
target***Very very disappointed !
source***I recommend to anyone who wants to dress up and impress the lady .
source***The lobster sandwich is $ 24 and although it was good it was not nearly enough to warrant that price .
target***The machine itself is alright .
target***After much battling with HP i was able to return it 4 times for repairs .
target***So , I paid a visit to LG notebook service center at Alexandra Road , hoping they can make the hinge tighter .
target***The computer continued to give me issues and in Late June it completely died again and I tried to call Acer again to get it fixed and they refused to help me , they said my warrenty was up and hung up on me .
target***As of a couple weeks ago the middle portion of the laptop from top to bottom , , , about 4 inches across is hardly visible .
source***We will definitely go back .
source***The restaurant looks out over beautiful green lawns to the Hudson River and the Statue of Liberty .
target***This unit is not .
target***I respond that I do not have the old computer and this way I would lose the data on my hard drive .
source***But , they were too big for the bun .
target***of course my warranty runs out next month .
target***Very good quality and well made .
source***Of course this atmosphere is lacking , but what do you expect from a 24 hour bagel place anyways ?
target***Did n't work when shipped from Walmartcom but went into a store and exchanged for a work laptop same make / model .
target***Still trying to learn how to use it .
source***I took my girlfriend there for her birthday last night and we had a relaxing , really good meal .
source***It saves walking in and waiting for a table in the often noisy , crowded bar at dinnertime .
target***In November my computer messed up entirely and would n't power on after intalling a Windows update , I had to have my HD flashed and lost EVERYTHING on it , including my school assignments and irriplaceable pictures that were only in digital format and several other things , when this update was installed for some reason I was unable to roll back the drivers and everything to an earlier working condition because when the update was installed it deleted my history .
source***It took them 15 minutes to put water in our glasses .
target***Using this machine is like a mild form of torture .
target***We did not even have it a year .
target***Sent unit back and it 's been two months .
target***three years is a decent life , but this must make it to graduation and beyond .
source***Keep up the good work guys !
source***Even better , they know how to cook French classics like Steak au Poivre and Onglet without burning it to death or overcooking it .
source***We usually just get some of the dinner specials and they are very reasonably priced and very tasty .
target***It runs perfectly .
source***The Italian food has flavor that can be sort of surprising on the UES , and the service turns from a nightmare to attentive , they sort of remind me of the NY Yankees of the late 90 's , no matter how bad it look , you knew that there was a rally just around the corner .
source***Just go and see for yourself .
source***I thanked my friend who recommended me this restaurant and will certainly recommend it to others .
source***The wine list is also really nice .
source***The fried dumplings are GREAT !
source***All the appetizers and salads were fabulous , the steak was mouth watering and the pasta was delicious ! ! !
source***Alain Ducasse is the best of everything , I mean everything was excelentI .
target***The graphics are great .
source***As a retired hipster , I can say with some degree of certainty that for the last year Lucky Strike has been the best laid - back late night in the city .
target***I have had another Mac , but it got slow due to an older operating system .
target***The price is another driving influence that made me purchase this laptop .
source***The food is delicious .
target***Beware , their staff could send you back making you feel that only they know what a computer is .
target***Much faster than my old windows laptop that died on me .
source***I had a huge pastrami sandwich on a roll .
source***But too far east !
source***A gentleman , maybe the manager , came to our table , and without so much as a smile or greeting asked for our order .
target***Learning all of the keyboard shortcuts only took a few minutes to get used to as some of the shortcuts are the same on Windows machines .
target***I bought this laptop because of the performance to price ratio .
source***Terrible experience .
target***But my blog is read by my friends and search engine visitors .
target***Its ease of use and the top service from Apple be it their phone assistance or bellying up to the genius bar can not be beat .
source***This is the best thing in Soho .
target***The letter A stopped working after the first week .
source***This is a consistently great place to dine for lunch or dinner .
target***My previous purchases were with Dell and HP .
target***The So called laptop Runs to Slow and I hate it !
target***The Time remaining goes from 4 hours plus to less than 2 hours over the span of about 10 minutes .
target***I love the glass touchpad .
target***The brand of iTunes has just become ingrained in our lexicon now , but keep in mind that Apple started it all .
target***It made the computer much easier to use and navigate .
target***The OS is also very user friendly , even for those that switch from a PC , with a little practice you can take full advantage of this OS !
target***So a couple of years later , I was a dumb college girl and had to have the wireless internet .
source***Beautiful experience .
source***When you enter , you feel like you have entered your mom 's kitchen .
target***Macs are designed for the frontal lobe challenged people out there .
source***I would highly recommend it .
source***If you do n't mind pre - sliced low quality fish , unfriendly staff and a sushi chef that looks like he is miserable then this is your place .
target***I honestly love my mac , that s why I am a self proclaimed mac addict .
source***I recommend the jelly fish , drunken chicken and the soupy dumplings , certainly the stir fry blue crab .
source***Wow over 100 beers to choose from .
target***I was so happy with my new Mac .
source***but when we looked at the menu , there were n't a lot of choices , most of them were dumplings in the appetizer section .
target***Also , HDD secures inside using rails , and there is only one set on the main hard drive .
source***I had the mango chicken and i ca n't go on to tell you how delicious that was and the presentation was beatiful .
source***I just read Mocaramel 's review and felt compelled to respond .
source***Another welcome addition to the neighborhood .
target***It has a overheating issue , nearly to the point of being dangerous .
source***I live in the neightborhood and am a regular .
target***And these are some reasons you should get a macbook pro .
source***I would highly recommend Nina 's to anyone who wants to have a romantic dinner in a heart warming surrounding filled with candles and family pictures .
target***The fact that the screen reacts to the lighting around you is an added luxury - when you are working around others in dark areas and want privacy or do n't want to bother them with bright lighting , it is very convenient to have a darker , softer lit screen .
target***I just love my Mac !
target***its more like a snail crawl .
target***I would definitely reccomend this if you are in the market for an easy to use , stylish , fun , awesome computer .
target***There is a backlit keyboard which is perfect for typing in the dark .
target***I ' ve already recommended this laptop to a friend who eye 'd the computer when I took it out of my bag .
target***Other than that , I would recommend this to someone in need of a cheap laptop with semi - decent gaming capabilities .
target***Apple care included .
source***We had champagne and caviar and felt like princesses !
target***Could nt not use it .
source***The kamasutra and bombay cosmopolitan are excellent and will have you tipsy in no time .
source***also make sure you pay attention to the music being piped in , quite a weird selection .
source***For the quality of food , a little too expensive .
target***I like to use it at the race track to handiecap the horse races .
target***It had a cooling system malfunction after 10 minutes of general use , and would not move past this error .
source***From the moment we walked in they were more than accomodating even though the place was packed .
target***Wonderful zooming .
source***I ' ve been many time and have never been disappointed .
target***It has spent more time in repair shops than i can possibly recount here .
source***The buffet had a nice selection .
source***I think locals rate this place so high .
target***It is good to know that I can mobilize without having to worry about the battery life .
target***There are differences that you need to know and take time to learn .
source***Everything about this restaurant was special .
target***It started out getting hot after only a few months .
source***Whem asked , we had to ask more detailed questions so that we knew what the specials were .
source***Do n't look down your nose at me like that .
target***the two of us use it regularly .
target***Files as well would become lost , deleted or corrupted .
target***My laptop is almost 2yrs old and I have never had any problems with it .
target***both upgrades were quickly accomplished after purchasing the necessary Product Key .
source***If you go here , your focus should be the Tamarind Margaritas .
source***Overall , not worth the money .
target***I sit down and use my husband 's work PC and I do n't like it one bit .
source***I do not recommend lunch specials just because it tasts the same with other regular chinese restaurant .
source***Look I do n't know if the people who wrote the reviews have ever been to a decent place PLEASE TRY SOMEOTHER PLACES .
source***The waitress remembers me and is very friendly , she knows what my regular is and that 's the fried mini buns with the condensed milk and the assorted fruits on beancurd .
source***I love the atmorphere @ peep !
target***I had my computer custom built from Sonystylecom .
source***Bottom line , B+ for the food , F for the service .
target***Fan vents to the side , so no cooling pad needed , great feature !
target***Now when I order I did not go full scale for the webcam or full keyboard I wanted something for basics of being easy to carry when I use crutchs or wheelchair and with a backpack laptop bag .
source***The sangria was pretty tasty and good on a hot muggy day .
source***The food is awesome , definitely try the striped bass .
target***They do n't seem to be susceptible to viruses , which is one less big thing to worry about when it comes to computers .

target***Instead of taking another chance on Toshiba , I went with an Asus G73JH - x3 .
source***We shared a bottle of sake , an order of edamames , and she had the sushi plate while I had the sashimi .
source***Try ordering from the regular menu , then you would not regret !
source***A one women show !
source***I have walked by this place for eons and finally went thanks to a girls night .
target***Now , , , , , my monitor has been acting up for about 2 months .
source***From the street it looks very hidden , and is actually an old warehouse .
source***The food is amazing , rich pastas and fresh doughy pizza .
source***We went to this restaurant based on prior internet comments .
target***but it has a major design flaw .
source***Also , the place is popular with families , so if you 're bothered by children running loose like wild animals , come later at night to avoid them .
target***I would definitely recommend checking out this laptop if you are in the market for one .
source***However , looking at the table next to ours , we both sort of wished we had ordered pizza , which looked PERRRRRRRRRFECT .
target***Good luck with your purchase options .
target***It has good speed and plenty of hard drive space .
target***It is super fast , and always loads .
target***For me , five stars is not enough .
source***I had Filet Mignon with garlic mash .
target***Every single one we ' ve gotten we ' ve had problems with .
target***Some problems can be fixed if you purchase new software , but there is no guarentee .
source***Highly recommended is the Spicy Fried Clam Rolls and Spider Rolls .
target***VERY disappointing ,
target***I actually had the hard drive replaced twice , the mother board once , the dvd drive twice , then they FINALLY agreed to replace it , ALL OF THIS IN LESS THAN 1 1/2 YEARS !
source***Where tanks in other Chinatown restaurants display a lurking myriad of sad - looking marine life in their murky waters , the tanks at Ping 's are clear as glass with healthy - looking creatures who do not yet know that they will be part of some dim sum lover 's brunch .
source***I actually gave Patroon another chance before writing this , but the second visit was even worse .
target***The apple macbook pro nothing to say butprofessionally great and outstanding .
target***I was psyched .
target***Now , as easy as it is to use , and I do think it is a great STARTER laptop .
source***Get the feeling they settled into a groove a while ago .
target***I ' ve had a Toshiba laptop in the past ;
source***While most people can attest to spending over $ 50 on drinks in New York bars and hardly feeling a thing , the drinks here are plentiful and unique .
target***My hp G60 - 244dx died after only 16 months .
target***Screen is crystal clear , yes it 's small , but it 's a netbook !
target***I 'd recommend this laptop to anyone !
target***I was so excited when my dad said i could get a new laptop for my birthday .
target***after much effort and 10 days ASUS replaced itThe WiFi is very weak .
source***both are very reasonably priced around $ 8 for dinner and $ 5 for lunch , and are delicious and filling .
target***I had finally reached my limit and broke down .
source***My turkey burger was not cooked at all , my friends salmon was completely raw .
target***-I propose that I can just swap the hard drives .
source***Both are delicious , the cooks are friendly and are willing to take a moment and speak to you and shake your hand .
target***falls into the case .
source***The sauce is delicious and the crust is perfect .
target***Other than that its a great performing machine and well meets all my needs and more .
target***A great computer for light home use and business use .
source***For the location , the prices are very reasonable .
source***The menu looked good , except for offering the Chilean Sea Bass , but the server does not offer up the specials that were written on the board outside .
source***Seriously , this is the best all you can eat in town As everyone says , the Spicy Tuna hand rolls are the best have 4 of these , and you ' ve broken even .
target***It is loaded with programs that is of no good for the average user , that makes it run way to slow .
target***Bought with a credit card .
target***Now I had not tried to use this since the disc drive had been replaced and after taking it back to the Geek Squad I found out they had accidently not used the right drive when they replaced the first one , so back it went to get the correct drive .
source***I went there in late afternoon for some bite size food and refleshment with my date .
target***I had the staff telling me older version did not make the fan noise cause it is a different computer .
target***However , the multi - touch gestures and large tracking area make having an external mouse unnecessary unless you 're gaming .
target***My husband purchased a laptop at the same time for about $ 300 less he got a pc .
source***The menu consisted of standard brassiere food , better then places like Balthazar etc .
target***Microsoft seems to be unable to keep up with repairs for the multitude of windows problems .
target***Waited on getting this computer , but it has been a great change .
target***Design , very durable .
target***Going to bring it to service today .
source***The makhani was OK -- the korma was bland .
target***There was a little difficulty doing the migration as the firewire cable system ca n't be used with the iBook .
target***Called tech support and got the usual Acer We do n't support software but for $ $ $ we can help you I explained there was no software involved in booting .
target***My brother is a computer wiz and would laugh at me because he used an Apple .
target***The 13 Macbook Pro just fits in my budget and with free shipping and no tax to CA this is the best price we can get for a great product .
source***Everyone treats you like you were part of the family .
source***It is about FOOD and Ambiance , and imagine how dreadful it will be it we only had to listen to an idle engine .
target***PC never worked right even after BIOS fixed .
target***HP refused to give me a new one and Wal Mart refused to take it back .
source***Excellent experience .
source***Upon entering , we were greeted by the owners , Steven and Frederick , who went out of their way to be more than gracious hosts .
target***It was not clear that the Microsoft Student Edition that was loaded on the computer , was a six month trial .
source***One of my favorites though was the Angry Lobster , a cold lobster salad that was magnificent .
target***Small screen somewhat limiting but great for travel .
source***great experience overall .
target***I love this 13 Mac white unibody .
source***It 's a shame that a nice , convenient place like the Pink Pony can be so ruined by lousy service .
source***I was pleasantly surprised to find this gem in Hoboken .
target***Stupidly , mind - numbingly slow -- then I found it can only be loaded with 2 GB * maximum * .
target***I tried out another Mac for a few months before buying this one and it is a great machine .
target***and looks very sexyy , D really the mac book pro is the best laptop specially for students in college if you are not caring about price .
target***Took a while to clean it up to my specs .
target***I ' m very impressed .
source***We just ate at Kai and were disapointed .
target***the last time we took it to get fixed the guy said that most likely it is a reppative problem and will keep happeneing so hopefully we can get a new one very soon !
target***Even though it is running Snow Leopard , 24 GHz C2D is a bit of an antiquated CPU and thus the occasional spinning wheel would appear when running Office Mac applications such as Word or Excel .
target***After 20 - 30 min the screen of the notebook switched off .
target***Whenever tried to turn it on , it would restart as soon as the BIOS launched Windows or Winblows , as I like ot call it .
target***This is my second MacBook .
target***The display on this computer is the best I ' ve seen in a very long time , the battery life is very long and very convienent .
target***I complain again .
source***Their whitefish salad is excellent -- all whitefish with a little mayo .
source***The last time I went we were seated at a table in a corridor next to the kitchen .
source***Considering their price of $ 625 for lunch special , the dish was ridiculously small .
source***My wife and I always enjoy the young , not always well trained but nevertheless friendly , staff , all of whom have a story .
target***I have had the luxury sarcasm of owning 2 of these laptops .
target***The only thing i can say is that the touch pad does nt work like it should all the time .
source***We did have to wait at the bar for approx .
source***For some reason , all the seafood on the menu was unavailable except for the Salmon .
source***We all ate pasta entre'es , which were great .
target***I was very excited because this was my first personal computer and I was purchasing it with my OWN money I had recieved from graduation presents .
target***So buyer beware when buying Toshiba
target***My husband got me this for Chrismas after getting me a very expensve laptop that did not work after 2 days .
source***I was in love with Pongsri on 48th , but compared to Suan it is slow in service and overpriced .
source***hmmm .
target***I fell in love with it .
target***I ' ve tried going back to XL but there still problems .
target***Be safe buy a Sony .
source***I ' ve eaten at many different Indian restaurants .
target***So far it has been five months since the last problem was fixed and I am PRAYING it has finally stopped .
source***They charge different prices all the time .
target***All apple associates are always wiling to help you out with anything , no matter when you purchased the computer and how many years passed .
source***What more could you want ?
target***The MacBook Pro is very sturdy and versatile .
source***Every time in New York I make it a point to visit Restaurant Saul on Smith Street .
source***20 minutes for our reservation but it gave us time to have a few cocktails and enjoy our surroundings and each other .
target***for being so small it is amazing that it is as fast as it is .
source***You get what you pay for and with that logic in mind , Spice is a great place to grab some cheap eats and drinks in a beautiful setting .
source***The food was delicious and the waiter was incredibly helpful and attentive considering we were the only ones there for the first hour .
source***I would n't even have complained at all if the food at least tasted good but the quality of food was crappy , too .
source***That said , I thought Scalini Fedeli was one of the best dining experiences I ' ve EVER had .
source***I had been searching really hard for a restaurant in New York where I could really feel unwanted and ignored and I finally found it !
source***I love this place .
target***For the [ $ ] price special offer this is a great laptop .
target***10 hours of battery life is really something else .
source***being a fan of spicy ethnic foods , indian included , i made friends with this place long ago .
source***The sauce on the pizza is sooo good with garlic and fresh tomatoes and they do n't skimp .
target***It was always getting froze up .
source***Everyone is welcomed in as family .
target***I have been a mac user since the mid 90s .
target***I WILL NEVER AGAIN buy another Acer , not will I buy Gateway , or eMachine as they are all from the same company .
target***My wife also has problems with her Asus , different model .

source***The food was great .
source***The food was very well prepared .
target***this laptop is great for work and doing my pictures .
source***I highly recommend visiting this restaurant and having dinner and drinks !
source***I have been twice to this restaurant .
source***Thalia is a beautiful restaurant with beautiful people serving you , but the food does n't quite match up .
source***The food was amazing , and the service was prompt and helpful , but not over - bearing or rushed .
target***My house is now 100 % Macbook .
target***And that probably explains why I ' ve already had my SATA controller go bad within a year of buying it .
target***I would like to have volume buttons rather than the adjustment that is on the front .
source***I ' m sure I 'll return for a final judgement tho .
target***Summary , After doing some investigation on the web , I have found that Toshiba NB205s are not chronically not booting .
target***The other day I had a presentation to do for a seminar at a large conference in town lots of people , little time to prep and have to set up a computer to a projector , etc .
source***I think I ' ve had some the best meals of my life at minnow .
target***Or the cursor would show up some place else .
source***The menu is very limited , i think we counted 4 or 5 entrees .
source***I ' ve been frequenting The Tasting Room since it first arrived in the East Village and I ' ve never been disappointed .
source***They treated us well and the food was extremely fresh and well - prepared .
source***I will be going back and heartily recommend it !
source***Plenty of choices to make your own creation .
target***For me , keys were starting to get stuck and would n't type very well .
source***keep up the good work .
source***If I could rate the people this place would be off the charts , unfortunately , the pizza , sorry , not the best in NYC .
source***It was tiny and I felt like I was eating in someone 's living room .
source***The entertainment was great they have shows that go on through out the dinner .
source***If your visiting , you 'll enjoy the ambiance and the fact that it 's in Time Sq .
source***However , go for the ambience , and consider the food just a companion for a trip across the world !
source***They offer the same menu but have creative drinks that are loaded with alcohol and cheeky names - but they do cost you .
target***It was a bad experience but i played down its importance .
source***The view is spectacular , and the food is great .
target***I lost two items I was working on until I figured out what was happening .
target***The # 1 reason that is always repeated .
source***I started out with a Bombay beer which was big enough for two .
target***This is a great computer .
source***Thank You Emilio .
source***Pizza was a little soggy .
source***First went here to enjoy their garden terrace .
target***The laptop was returned but audio issue was not fixed .
source***The menu choices are similar but the taste lacked more flavor than it looked .
target***The Hewitt Packard Pavillion dv6700 was my first laptop , before this I had a Dell desktop that I loved .
source***We were told that the wait was about twenty minutes and there would be no problem for our 8 , 00 pm curtain call .
target***Got the computer back a month later and it was still broken sent it out again and they repaired it .
target***I can have both OSX and Windows XP running at the same time !
target***I thought the price was great for the specs .
target***I ' ve had it now about 2 months and absolutely LOVE IT .
source***The service was mediocre , and the lack of air conditioning made for a less than comfortable meal .
source***The $ 300 bill was a bit steep , but the experience was great .
target***And if you are a game player it works with World Of Warcraft wonderfully .
target***After paying over $ 1000 for this computer , it was not worth it .
target***You will need them if you want to reload the OS I recommend doing if you can to start fresh and optimal .
target***I thought all my problems would finally be solved being that my old computer would n't go onto our wireless network and I would n't have the same problems because it was updated .
source***My friends and I have been going here regularly for two years .
target***Also it is very good for college students who just need a reliable , easy to use computer .
target***This is basically the best laptop I have ever had or used .
target***This is a nicely sized laptop with lots of processing power and long battery life .
target***I constantly had to send my laptop in for services every 3 months and it always seems to be the same problem that they said they had already fixed .
target***power supply went bad after 2 weeks --
source***i recommend the thai popcorn ,
source***I loved everythig about it - especially the shows and actors .
source***i actually feel like i should keep it a secret .
source***Nevertheless the food itself is pretty good .
source***Nicky the Nose at the bar is a treat .
source***I go at least 3 times a month and have never been disappointed .
target***You will not regret buying such a great thing like this !
source***They have it all - great price , food , and service .
target***I love windows 7 but i ca n't give Toshiba any credit for that , unless y' all get serious about ergonomics and making required connections less obtrusive i will be looking to different manufacturer next time .
source***All of it was simply amazing , unique and tasty and best of all it did n't break the bank .
source***I loving bringing friends here , and I do so every chance I get .
source***I ' m amazed we have n't been kicked out of this place yet .
target***It came alot faster than I thought it would have which was really exciting .
source***This is one of my favorite restaurants and it is not to be missed .
source***Haru on Park S is simply disgusting .
source***good music , great food , speedy service affordable prices .
target***My macbook is so much better looking and so thin !
source***This place is so much fun .
source***Definitely worth the trip to Battery Park City !
source***After we got our sashimi order , I could not believe how small the portions were !
source***I ' m no food critic , but I 'd like to think I have a tiny bit of experience under my belt having lived in NY for the last 11 years .
source***but overall i give it a 10
source***And , atlhough tables opened up next to us and we ASKED for a slightly larger space , they left us awkardly seated .
source***Service was also very good .
target***They definitely have a superior product !
source***The food is delicious , from the specials to the regular menu - fare , the dishes are never a disappointment .
source***Great food , great prices , great service .
source***Even after they overcharged me the last time I was there .
target***Not super fancy , but not super expensive either .
target***Windows 7 Starter is terrific no you ca n't change the background but I do n't need to , I use it just for school work .
target***The screen resolution was exactly what I was looking for .
source***Here 's to the fake fish tanks too .
target***It had most of the features and all of the power that I wanted to replace my desktop machine .
target***It 's great and we will always stick with Apple computers , we have been so happy with them .
source***if you 're looking for perfect traditional sushi , go here , if you 're looking for interesting combinations , try sushi of gari 's east side .
source***They never brought us complimentary noodles , ignored repeated requests for sugar , and threw our dishes on the table .
source***I ' ve eaten at Pizza Gruppo a few times , but more often I order delivery .
source***If you were there when it first opened , give this restaurant a second chance .
target***And not to mention after using it for a few months or so , the battery will slowly less and less hold a charge until you ca n't leave it unplugged for more than 5 minutes without the thing dying .
target***It is short on space , and downloads always had problems being completed , or were said to be corrupted ' .
target***It was secure and easy to navigate .
source***We asked to be moved which took half an hour , and then were seated in a high traffic area in the back , even though the rest of the room was practically empty .
source***stick with the chicken , beef , and lamb dishes .
source***It 's a great place to pick up a cheap lunch or dinner .
source***Largest and freshest pieces of sushi , and delicious !
target***After numerous attempts of trying including setting the clock in BIOS setup directly , I gave upI am a techie .
source***I do n't get it either .
source***From the appetizers we ate , the dim sum and other variety of foods , it was impossible to criticize the food .
target***This thing sucks !
target***This is the first time that I tried and owning a netbook although I have used 3 different laptops in the past 10 years , I find not much difference except of course for the screen size .
target***Enabling the battery timer is useless .
target***Overall I feel this netbook was poor quality , had poor performance , although it did have great battery life when it did work .
target***I took it in to the Apple store and guess what ? They fixed it , no cost out of pocket .
source***We ended our great experience by having Gulab Jamun ( dessert ) recommended by the waiter .
target***In short I would never buy a Compaq again .
source***The service was friendly and the atmosphere was casual .
target***The only downfall is the volume control .
target***It played various games without problems and ran aero smoothly and flawlessly .
source***This place has got to be the best japanese restaurant in the new york area .
source***$ 160 for 2 filets , 2 sides , an appetizer and drinks .
source***one of the best Chicken Tikka Masala .
source***I really recommend the very simple Unda ( Egg ) rolls .
target***also it is light weight compared to others .
target***It is easily portable and I take it everywhere I go and might require internet access .
source***Took my sister here before attending a show one evening .
target***Apparently they 're not special anymore .
source***Incredible food at a very agreable price brings me back just about every other day to this authentic Thai restaurant .
target***Though the picture , video , and music software is nowhere close to professional grade software I m used to CS5 but does the job for beginner and even intermediate media designers .
target***Navigation through the computer is far superior compared to Windows operating systems , as well .
target***Before I got my macbook , I owned a Dell laptop .
target***This is the first laptop I ' ve owned , althougth I used several at my previous job .
target***I HATE this one .
source***Not a large place , but it 's cute and cozy .
target***If you really want a bang - up system and do n't need to run Windows applications , go with an Apple ;
source***The bruscetta is a bit soggy , but the salads were fresh , included a nice mix of greens not iceberg all dishes are served piping hot from the kitchen .
source***It was divine melts in your mouth .
source***i love the pics of andy warhol when he used to frequent the place he painted the ballato 's sign in the window .
target***The tech guy then said the service center does not do 1-to-1 exchange and I have to direct my concern to the " sales " team , which is the retail shop which I bought my netbook from .
target***Dell Latitude d620 is not a reliable machine .
target***I can throw anything at it and I do , Pictures , video editing , schoolwork .
target***I work with kids and they love making short videos on there .
target***I saw this one , and I have the most difficult time trying to use them , they ' ve made great dust collectors , I hate putting this computer down
target***The notebook is lacking a HDMI port and a S - video port that would enable one to hook it to a TV .
target***This is my second laptop , and it is head and shoulders above my first .
source***I had to ask her three times before she finally came back with the dish I ve requested .
target***That 's right , no power , absolutely NOTHING .
target***It was about six months later when the overheating problem started again , to the point it felt like fire on the bottom of the machine !
target***I now realize that my $ 900 would have been better spent on a Windows laptop .
target***Battery is lasting about 6 hours as I am surfing the web on Sundays while checking football scores and watching funny Youtube videos .
target***Dealing with the support drone on the other end of the chat was sheer torture .
source***The food is very good too but for the most part , it 's just regular food , nothing special .
target***I ' m going back to PC .
target***I paid for extra memory and the 17-inch screen , as well as the top of the line DVD and CD burners .
source***Overall , I ' m still impressed that the place even exists and the prices are quite decent but then again , its Chinatown .
source***When he finally did , he was unable to make a gin and tonic - could n't find tonic .
source***Indoor was very cozy and cute .
source***A little crowded but they move that line really fast !
target***My dad has one of the very first Toshibas ever made , yes its abit slow now but still works well and i hooked to my ethernet !
source***But the thai is definitely not great - bland and indistinguished .
source***Delicious food at a great price but do not go here on a cold day and sit by the front door .
source***This was n't the expected menu comprised only of pad thai and tom yum soup , but I thought that was what made the place so special .
target***The battery life is probably an hour at best .
source***Judging from previous posts this used to be a good place , but not any longer .
target***Crisp screen , great battery life , and plenty of storage .
source***As soon as I wake up on a saturday or sunday it is the first thing on my mind is when and how I will be getting to fried dumpling .
target***apple and quess what , you have to send the whole laptop in , too bad , so sad
target***I have not have any problems .
target***And it did n't show up on the reciept , I do n't know how we ordered it online !
target***Then 2 of my nephews were going into music and both fell in love with the MacBook Pro .
target***This computer gets very hot , before shutting down .
target***My opinion of Sony has been dropping as fast as the stock market , given their horrible support , but this machine just caused another plunge .
source***My husband and I enjoyed each of the 6 taste size portions and left completely full .
source***I ' ve been coming here as a child and always come back for the taste .
target***The computer could have been shipped by Priority Mail through the USPS for the same cost and arrived by Noon on Tue .
source***delicious bagels , especially when right out of the oven .
source***The secret is the lunch menu which offers a complimentary appetizer with every entree ordered .
target***its sad because their commercials are great .
source***It just was n't Thai .
target***The great 18 month same as cash financing and Advance Protection Plan which includes accidents like spills .
source***I did n't take a look at the rest menu , but the oysters were fantastic .
target***-Apparently , contactus @ euroapplecom is not a good address to send complaints .
source***It is very overpriced and not very tasty .
source***Edible but really a ripoff at those prices given what s in the area .
source***Ambiance relaxed and stylish .
source***The aesthetics of this place are like an airport lounge .
source***The food was good .
source***What a ripoff !
target***I upgraded it 's RAM to 2 GB , I am very happy with it .
target***ca n't reinstall with standard os cd because of proprietary hardware drivers .
target***I realize that not every unit has this issue , but the ones that do can not be repaired .
source***I have eaten at many pizza places around NYC and this is hands down the worst .
target***The Apple applications exASPECT1 are fun , easy , and really cool to use unlike the competition ! .
source***Love Pizza 33 .
target***I just hope the reputation that Toshiba has is true and I wo n't have to worry about a crash .
source***We began with the cheese fondue the artisanal blend and added apples and kielbasa to dip .
target***The built - in webcam is great for Skype and similar video - chat services .
source***It was like the servers forgot that they actually worked there and instead wanted to hang out and be cool .
target***pretty much everything else about the computer is good it just stops working out of no were .
target***Waited on getting this computer , but it has been a great change .
source***If celebrities make you sweat , then your in for a ride , but if your like most around these parts then you 'll just yawn and wonder what s with all the hype .
source***I ' ve dined at Alain Ducasse 's restaurant in Monte Carlo for half the price for the same excellent dining experience .
target***But in fact it is totally the opposite .
target***I get a ton of compliments on its size , and speaking as someone who regularly commutes on a bus , I can attest to the fact that this is the perfect size computer if you 're restricted to the width of your body for computing room .
source***I liked the beer selection !
target***Right out of the box , this little netbook did everything I asked of it , including streaming the everyday video you 're bound to encounter checking mail and websites my biggest complaint previously .
target***I continued to take the computer in AGAIN and they replaced the hard drive and mother board yet again .
source***The anti - pasta was excellent , especially the calamari , as were the filling pasta mains .
source***Food was average and creme brulee was awful , the sugar was charred , not caramelized and smelled of kerosene .
target***I have used PC 's and converting to this MacBook Pro was easy .
target***The screen is bright and the keyboard is nice ;
target***This is the first macbook I have ever had .
source***I ' ve been to this monster sushi twice , the 46th st once , the 23rd st one a number of times .
source***then we ordered a dinosaur rolls and white tuna sashimi .
source***Even though it is a little loud , you do n't have to yell at each other to talk .
source***This restaurant is a wonderful place to go many times and it is reasonably priced .
target***I also purchased iWork to go with it which has programs for word processing , spreadsheets , and presentations similar to Microsoft Office .
source***Never once did I leave feeling unwelcome or impressed .
source***The design and atmosphere is just as good .
source***We were less than impressed .
source***I have never had anything like it !
target***i needed one to be able to carry to work everyday and this one seems to fit all of the criteria .
target***the laptop preformed pretty well .
source***While I quite liked the food and the ambience , I ' m not quite sure if it they really deserve it the Michelin rating they have displayed so prooudly in the window .
target***A lot of help they WERE N'T !
source***I liked the food at this quasi - thai restaurant .
target***Once again , I was told it was the suspicious power supply problem .
source***When you want a piece of beef , head on over .
source***We were seated and ignored by waitstaff .
target***Product support very poor as each phone call costs me long distan
source***The one on the east side is much better than the one on the west side .
target***The sheer power and flexibility makes the MacBook Pro a must have for any techie !
target***It 's the most wonderful thing in the entire world .
target***The screen is gorgeous , yummy good .
source***To finish off such a delightful dinner experience you must have dessert , especially the White Chocolate Bread Pudding with Gelato and hot chocolate .
source***Admittedly , this is not the place for gigantic pieces of fish overflowing the plate and thank goodness , in my opinion but for simple , elegant sushi there is no better place in New York or anywhere in the US .
target***The Toshiba laptop I am using is easier to use than most I have tried .
source***Go here .
source***Light , refreshing summer rolls not fried remind me of Vietnamese places in Paris .
source***Either that , or the editor 's idea of romance must be sharing a conversation with the next table , while trying to speak louder than the traffic on 57th .
target***So when you do call to complain about the hunk of metal you get the joy of speaking with a bunch of people you ca n't understand .
source***I definitely will go back .
source***And I ' ve been to many NYC delis .
target***With today 's company fighting over marketshare , its a shame that ASUS can get away with the inept staff answering thephone .
target***My friends or children use that when they need to borrow the Net When I out grow this Meaning when its old and my oldest child is ready for one she will get this one ANd I will be buying only TOSHIBA !
source***As a fan of Thai , I have tried quite a few different restaurants in NYC and this one was definitely the worst .
target***NO more Lenovo for me .
target***They do n't crash .
source***This was on a Tuesday night .
target***He did n't work for sony , he was just approved to fix their crappy products .
target***Apple continues to shine and provide a much more enjoyable computer experience !
target***They told me it was my loss even though it was the computer , not what I ' ve done .
target***So honestly , I was n't expecting anything less than perfection , and I was n't disappointed .
target***I tell everyone I see out looking to get this or another Toshiba .
source***The service is good and ambience is good for a date or group outing .
source***Service was slow had to wait to order and get food although not crowded .
target***No viruses .
source***The most annoying thing , though , is the fact that the servers seem to be trained to drive revenue .
source***We had a 3 hour brunch they definitely do not rush you and they kept the unlimited mimosas flowing the whole time .
target***It 's perfect for everything and runs faster than an average pc !
source***I have been to Mary 's many times and I like it .
target***The screen is bright and clear , the operating system is solid and friendly to a novice .
target***i would never go back any more , i love this computer so much and i would recommend it to everyone .
target***But sadly the replacement froze - up while updating the BIOS again and shut down and would not turn back on .
target***the programs are esay to use and are quick to process this computer works like a charm .
target***Keyboard is great , very quiet for all the typing that I do .
source***I know this is the case in many nyc eateries , but here , they really cram you in to the point where it 's borderline uncomfortable .
target***It also does not have bluetooth .
target***I got a mac as my HS graduation gift .
target***It also came with a built it web cam which is great because I can see an communicate with my family members back home .
target***The sound is a bit quiet if you 're on a plane , this can easily be overcome with a decent pair of head phones .
source***A few tips , skip the turnip cake , roast pork buns and egg custards .
source***I have been to spice three times twice during lunch and once at dinner .
target***If a website ever freezes which is rare , its really easy to force quit .
source***The problem is just that - it is a sometimes kind of affair .
source***I often go there to eat with my family .
source***this one is definintely my least favorite .
target***In those three years , I ' ve had a couple of minor problems and both were resolved by Apple quickly and easily .
source***I REALLY ENJOYED THE SHOWS PUT ON BY THE ACTORS .
source***This place has good potential , but needs a significa n't amount of work before we can justify spending that much money on indian food you can get everywhere else .
target***2nd Best computer in the world only one way this computer might become the best is that it needs to upgreade patches to make less easier for people to hack into
source***The spicy tuna and salmon are the best we ' ve ever had .
source***Worth the trip from Manhattan .
source***The jukebox plays everything from Italian Opera to The Strokes .
target***if this computer every breaks down on me i will most definatly get the same one again .
target***And Toshiba is totally unconcerned .
source***The Waitstaff were very nice and suggested swordfish for my husband he enjoyed his meal .
target***One of the smartest thing I did was take my time to compare laptops before making my purchase .
source***I have tried the various slice joints around the village but this is by far the best one .
target***I am just amazed .
target***I made a photo book as a gift , on my computer , pushed Buy and it drew from my iTunes account and sent the book to my house , the book was of perfect quality - exactly how I had created it and looked better than I had even imagined .
source***Oh and it 's too tiny for families with strollers .
target***Great product .
target***I wiped nearly everything off of it , installed OpenOffice and Firefox , and I am operating an incredibly efficient and useful machine for a great price .
source***The service was excellent , the food was excellent , but the entire experience was very cool .
source***I had the best ravioli ever .
target***I ' m really impressed with the quality and performance for the price of the computer .
source***Not the typical NYC gimmick theme restaurant .
source***My mouth starts to water merely thinking about the delight that is this restaurant .
target***Fast , fast and fast , the web pages just fly by .
source***I ' m glad I was introduced to this place and this is a rare gem in NY .
target***Pretty disappointed about this product .
target***It has bein into the shop to get a new hardrive 2 times and to fix the touch control buttons on the keyboard !
source***Great food , great decor , great service .
target***It has all the features that are necessary for college and if not they are able to be added onto the computer .
target***This is my 3rd Apple Laptop and first MacBook Pro .
source***The environment is romantic , but the food is horrible , the service is pathetic , and gabriella lies about everything she could .
target***apple has a reputation and is well known for its easy usage .
source***The location is perfect .
target***But see the macbook pro is different because it may have a huge price tag but it comes with the full software that you would actually need and most of it has free future updates .
target***-got it back 3 months later
source***We went to eat at the Jekyll and Hyde restaurant on Friday night and really enjoyed the fun atmosphere and good food .
target***This is my first personal Satellite purchase but had very good experience through previous Satellite work issued laptops .
target***The advantages of owning a mac are numerous .
target***I bought this laptop for my son in 2007 for his Christmas present .
source***And I could do without the cigar smoke .
source***My goodness , everything from the fish to the rice to the seaweed was absolutely amazing .
target***I have the A65 , right now it 's a paperweight .
target***This laptop meets every expectation and Windows 7 is great !
target***These new problems were the final straws ;
source***Nothing against a good sales call , but the tactics at Amma are just too obvious .
source***After all that , they complained to me about the small tip .
target***Ca n't close the 2nd HDD bay since there are brackets you have to break off even then , it still does n't shut That could be a major flaw for the dual HDD user .
source***Only complaint would be that at an average cost of $ 12- $ 15 per meal , I 'd like not to have to worry about finding a seat !
source***The blond wood decor is very soothing , the premium sake is excellent and the service is great .
target***I left the place angrily .
source***The freshest , best variety , and the fastest delivery .
target***I had something else go wrong and they said it had to be in good working order to be able to buy the warranty .
source***The service is descent even when this small place is packed .
source***and yes Dal Bukhara is so dam good and so are all the kababs .
source***I almost hesititate to write a review because the atmosphere was so great and I would hate for it too become to crowded .
target***Thank you for your great product !
source***Have recommended the place to friends , always gets good response .
source***Obviously run by folks who know a pie .
target***I have other computers that get strong signals that do n't drop in places that this netbook loses its signal .
target***Suffice it to say , my MacBook Pro keeps me going with its long battery life and blazing speed .
source***We ended the dinner with a surprisingly light and flaky apple tarte tatin .
target***DO NOT BUY GATEWAY COMPUTERS THEY ARE JUNK AND THE WARRANTY COMPANY IS HORRIBLE .
target***The next time I had an issue my lightscribe would n't work .
source***I found this restaurant to be one that truly values its patrons .
source***if this happens , just ask for real naan .
target***I work on a PC at home and have used Pc all through college .
source***great place to go for a drink too because they have 100 kinds of beer .
source***I am Indian , and I have tried many Indian places in NY .
target***i asked many people , search on the net and also read reviews here in best buy .
source***I had the salmon dish and while it was fine , for the price paid , I expected it to have some type of flavor .
target***I ' m not going to lie , I ' ve never really liked the Acer brand in general .
source***Leave the kids at home !
target***The speakers on it are useless too .
target***A month or so ago , the freaking motherboard just died .
target***I previously owned a Toshiba and it only lasted about 2 years .
target***I agree with the previous comment that ASUS TECH SUPPORT IS HORRIBLE WHICH IS A CON IN MY OPINION .
target***People know what they are talking about and they have pride in the product that they are selling .
target***Has met or exceeded my needs for a compact travel device .
source***We have lived in Chelsea for two years and have never noticed this restaurant .
target***It makes doing schoolwork at night so much easier .
source***The service was fast and friendly and the food was very tasty and they had the best hot sauce to add to your meals .
source***But people from Sichuan will die for it , Chongqing Hot Pot , chongqing was the biggest city of Sichuan , now became an independent province .
target***Also , because of the size and consistancy of the laptop computer , some websites would n't even attempt to work on the computer because of browser problems .
target***I wanted something that had a new Intel Core processors and HDMI port so that we could hook it up directly to our TV .
source***I am surprised to say the least and find such practice not worth the effort .
target***And if you do a lot of writing , editing is a problem since there is no forward delete key .
target***I LOVE IT !
target***I can do everything I could before , only faster and more efficiently .
source***Waitstaff are very friendly .
source***Go only if you are already in the neighborhood and do n't want to bother going farther for a better place .
target***The difference in the Apple keyboard from a PC 's keyboard took a bit of tim to get used to , but overall it 's worth it !
source***It is simply amazing .
target***It 's software and speed enable it to do amazing things .
target**** 6th week*-They are not responding to my emails asking when they expect to dispatch the new unit .
target***I had to adjust my mousepad sensitivity , because it is very sensitive .
source***for dessert we split chocolate cake and vanilla gelato with espresso , which were tasty , but I thought a bit overpriced .
source***The food is great , service is ok .
source***Have eaten at Ginger House several times , and it 's always good .
target***very very slow laptop .
target***I went to my local Best Buy looking for a new laptop since mine broke .
source***Why make a reservation if you are n't going to keep it ?
source***During the course of the past 3 months , the chef and staff changed and it was not for the better .
source***They smell like they stuff them with old canned vegetables like the spinach mushroom calzone .
source***Because we did n't have a reservation , we could only sit in the back garden , but it was great , secluded and perfect in nice weather .
target***Posted Nov 8 , 2010 , Two weeks ago I bought this notebook .
source***For Park avenue I expected so much more .
source***The place is a BISTRO which means , simple dishes and wine served efficiently in a bustling atmosphere .
source***The wine is always good , the tapas are always yummy , especially with the warm pita bread .
target***Typically , when I purchase a new laptop I always end up using an external mouse for convenience .
target***cosmetically , the only thing they changed was 2 of the Function keys at the top .
source***They might be all business at the counter when you give your order , but their food says I love you .
source***I was n't thrilled to have to wait on line for thirty minutes , but I guess that 's the price you pay for a popular place .
source***Please try the Filet Mignon , its just the most tender piece ever .
target***The i5 blows my desktop out of the water when it comes to rendering videos .
target***Do you think I purposely destroy my netbook , so that I can demand a new set ? Do you think it 's fun to take public transport all the way to the service center and get a non - satisfactory solution ? Or rather NO solution .
target***Probably wo n't work either .
target***It took a little over 2 weeks until i got it back .
target***Despite the inconvenient weight , I opted for the 12 cell battery .
target***The OS is still as fast as the day that the laptop was purchased and continues to run flawlessly .
target***I highly recommend this product !
source***They outshine HH .
source***You get the sense that the people there care about their restaurant and about your experience and that is very nice .
source***In fact , it appears he is going to go postal at any moment .
source***These innovators of french indian fusion do a great job of making dishes as interesting as possible while still being accessible .
target***No waiting to have my claim reviewed by someone in another state or more often , another country .
target***The trackpad was easy to learn and navigate .
source***I have eaten a lot of pizza here .
source***A pleasant surprise .
target***Before i bought my new i5 , I did my research for about 2 weeks and determined to move for HP to Apple for reliability , dependable , and long lasting operations .
source***Service was slow , but the people were friendly .
source***We actually left hungry and went across the street to Wo Hop at 15 Mott street for some good chinese food .
target***One night I turned the freaking thing off after using it , the next day I turn it on , no GUI , screen all dark , power light steady , hard drive light steady and not flashing as it usually does .
source***Very good value
target***IT WANT TAKE IT , IT KEEP SAYING ERROR .
source***Definately check it out ! ! !
source***Tuk Tuk is one of the rare choices for me to go in Brooklyn .
source***We thought this a prelude to what the evening will be like .
target***I bought it for really cheap also and it 's AMAZING .
target***The first full charge of this battery got me only about 2 full hours .
target***This laptop is the most amazing little peice of machinery I have owned outside of the Iphone .
source***I care more about the food and ambience .
target***Congratulations Asus for creating one big piece of dump which is my laptop .
target***When I got the computer back and realizwed it still was not correct HP told me it was out of warranty and now it was my problem .
source***Forget the rush and the wait and the noise which is n't actually that bad , I mean please , who goes to a steakhouse to be coddled and romantic ?
target***Very happy .
source***It was so bad I actually refused to pay for my food .
source***The service varys from day to day sometimes they 're very nice , and sometimes not .
target***The computer was shipped to their repair depot on june 24 and returned on July 2 seems like a short turn around time except the computer was not repaired when it was returned .
source***He always says , I do n't have customers .
target***still testing the battery life as i thought it would be better , but am very happy with the upgrade .
source***The manager claimed that he could not compensate us for anything on the bill which just shows the lack of sophistication from the entire group .
source***The Yellowtail was particularly good as well .
source***I asked for seltzer with lime , no ice .
source***HIGHLY RECOMMENDED ! ! ! ! !
source***For great chinese food nearby , you have Wu Liang Ye and Grand Sichuan just a block away .
target***Love it so far .
target***Eventually my battery would n't charge , so unless I had it plugged in it would n't even power on .
target***For some odd reasons the computer does n't reconize the operation system .
target***Do your research on this issue .
source***This place is a literal hole - in - the - wall that is buried within Doyers , right off of Pell St barber 's alley in Chinatown .
source***Pizza is terrific , as is homemade pasta .
source***The food was really good , I had the onion soup and it was one of the best ever .
source***My husband and I thougt it would be great to go to the Jekyll and Hyde Pub for our anniversary , and to our surprise it was fantastic .
source***If you are someone who appreciates the same things but hope to have food to spare or share , Kai may not be the best option .
source***Eating in , the atmosphere saves it , but at your desk , it 's a very disappointing experience .
source***Ambiance is barely romantic but management tries .
source***Try the spicy wontons and the salt pepper shrimps .
target***I babyed the heck out of it and i still do .
target***And at one point , they blame me for installing a bad memory stick when I upgrade my memory for the first time during my purchase of the laptop I bought the memory stick they recomended .
target***only good thing is the graphics quality .
source***I do n't live in NY but my best friend does .
source***Oh yeah ever on the west side try there sister resturant Arties Cafe .
source***Also very inexpensive .
target***company provides UPS shipping , fast , great !
target***I tell everyone that I know , friends , family and enemies this is the absolute worst computer i have ever used .
source***We picked it randomly , without a recommendation from someone who has been there , so we were n't sure what to expect .
source***It could have been handled better .
source***Where Gabriela personaly greets you and recommends you what to eat .
target***My computer froze on several occasion , had buttons that randomely would fall off and even had moments when the computer would refuse to turn on at all .
target***great machine if you want to drop the cash for one .
target***I ca n't say enough good for it !
source***They do n't concern much of customer 's health , just want to make money .
source***good selection of wines ranging from affordable to high end .
target**** 4 weeks after giving the computer for repair*-Annoyed at MacHouse Amsterdam , decided to send complaint email to Apple .
target***But sitting on a lap or on a desk in front of you it looks more than big enough this could be because I m used to my Lenovo 10 tablet now plus this is a great size if I want to unplug the external keyboard , mouse , and monitor to take it with me when I take photos and video .
target***I am a freelance graphic artist .
source***I like Cafe Noir do n't get me wrong , it is jsut that the people who work there are evil and incompetent ! !
source***I consider the best Grand Sichuan restaurant in NYC .
source***Service was very good , prompt , attentive and non - intrusive .
source***Village is one of those places that scores on all fronts .
target***i give this laptop a five star review i love it and it has done chams for me .
target***I can barely use any usb devices because they will not stay connected properly .
source***Three courses , choices include excellent mussels , puff pastry goat cheese and salad with a delicious dressing , and a hanger steak au poivre that is out of this world .
target***But the biggest pain is that tech support is not available 24/7 .
target***Laptop was in new condition and operational , but for the audio problem when 1st sent for repair .
target***Yes , they cost more , but they more than make up for it in speed , construction quality , and longevity .
source***I would definitely go back for a very special occasion , but not for regular fine dining .
target***super fast processor and really nice graphics card .
source***His drinks are very inventive , delicious and classy .
source***Turned out there was full service upstairs and sat down .
target***I had it four months when my disc drive refused to open .
target***Such as PAGES , NUMBERS , and so on .
target***I love this laptop , and use it everyday to do something , and never lets me down .
source***And they have these home made potato chips at the bar that are the most delicious things in the world !
target***I liked the aluminum body .
target***The macbooks are small enough to be very portable yet hold tons of information and performance .
source***At 5 dumplings for $ 1 , you just can not go wrong .
target***After paying several hundred dollars for this service , it is frustrating that you can not get help after hours .
target***The processor screams , and because of the unique way that Apple OSX 16 functions , most of the graphics are routed through the hardware rather than the software .
source***The scallion pancakes and fried dumplings were nothing out of the ordinary .
source***Overall , the best bagel in town .
target***Only issue is that it is a little slow , and I ' m fixing that by adding more RAM .
source***Going to Volare is like going to your favorite aunt 's house for dinner , assuming that your aunt is a great Italian cook .
target***Asus facial recognition does n't work and windows logon is n't either .
source***But , hey , there is anything better with a decent vegetarian selection in Astoria .
source***Great place to grab a hot bagel on the way to work .
target***Is this partially due to the fact that it is running Windows Vista ?
target***the battery is irreplaceable .
source***If you are looking for a good quality , cheap eats , this is the place .
source***I absolutely love this place ! ! !
target***The switchable graphic card is pretty sweet when you want gaming on the laptop .
source***I ' ve always been seated propmtly .
source***I went to this restaurant with a woman that I met recently .
target***The overall build quality of the unit is excellent and she 'd recommend it to anyone else looking for a netbook .
target***for 2 months .
source***I keep my fingers crossed the whole subway ride hoping that there will be a table I can sit at by myself and not have to share with the rice congee soup people .
target***This a starter notebook .
source***The food looked very appetizing and delicious since it came on a variety of fancy plates .
source***Katz 's has been a NYC original for over 100 years .
target***Anyways I bought this two months ago and when I first brought it home it kept giving me a message about a vibration in the hard drive and it is putting it temporaly in save zone .
target***The only thing that I do n't like about my mac is that sometimes there are programs that I want to be able to run and I am not able to .
target***Startup in about 30 seconds , shutdown in 2 - 4 seconds , resume from sleep in 0 - 2 seconds .
target***They had me send in the machine last April returned it to me in May with no documentation on what was done it anything .
target***All I will say now is that it was over two grand less expensive and so much better quality than my hunk of crap Vaio .
source***The red sliding doors may be unique but they do not block off the cold air from the outside .
target***I like it better than my big Dell Laptop .
source***This restaurant was way overhyped .
source***Not the greatest sushi place , but excellent for a $ 1995 all you can eat .
source***The menu was impressive with selections ranging from a burger , to steak , to escargot .
source***A guaranteeed delight !
source***Besides , when you have bad service , that 's less money you have to tip .
source***The prices are wonderfully low .
target***HP Pavilion DV9000 Notebook PC When I first got this computer , it really rocked .

source***I ve passed by the spot tons of times always wanting to go in .
target***I am glad I did my research .
source***whoever the jazz duo was , they were on POINT .
source***My husband and I enjoy Sangria .
source***In the evening , this place attracted a well dressed , with it , NY crowd .
source***The food was absolutely horrible !
target***very convenient when you travel and the battery life is excellent .
target***I do not experience a lot of heat coming out of it , however I would highly suggest purchasing a stand however , due to the nature of the design of the macbook as it is one very large heat sink .
source***The food is wonderful , tasty and filling , and the service is professional and friendly .
target***This laptop rocks only wish it could run SolidWorks CAD , which Apple does n't support !
source***My Girlfriend and I stumbled onto this hopping place the other night and had a great time !
target***We are addicted to the Mac .
target***They sent me a replacement part and without informing me are requiring that I return it within 15 days or contact them and let them know the broken part will be returned later .
source***Food was good and the view of the new york city skiline was terrific even on a foggy rainy day like that of when I went .
source***Got a little loud after 8 pm when the joint got full .
target***Well , I have to say since I bought my Mac , I wo n't ever go back to any Windows .
target***I had static in the output , and I had to reduce the sound output quality to FM as opposed to the default CD .
target***I bought this laptop about a month ago to replace my compaq laptop .
target***It is fast and i have not had a problem with internet connection or any other problems .
source***Perhaps it was an off night , but it was suprisingly average for a 93 rating .
source***And its absolutely DELICIOUS .
source***I do n't think I would go again .
target***Received the product promptly and without any issues .
target***The size is perfect and I do not recomend anything bigger except for any person who can exceed the limited space it gives you .
target***BEST BUY , 5 STARS + + + sales , service , respect for old men who are n't familiar with the technology DELL COMPUTERS , 3 stars DELL SUPPORT , owes a me a couple
source***They could n't even make a salad that was appealing .
source***We had a wonderful meal at Naples 45 a month ago on a visit to NYC .
source***I ' ve had the lunch buffet at Chennai a couple of times , when I have been in the neighborhood .
source***I think this is one of the more underrated places in the city .
source***Visited there while on vacation and reading the reviews .
source***Heartland Brewery is a great way to start or finish your day .
source***For $ 600 the most we have ever paid not even waving a magic wand will ever get us back for a repeat performance .
source***We were on our way back to NJ , and since I am in NY , we figured why not grab some food ?
target***I love the size , keyboard , the functions .
source***Good bagels and good cream cheese .
source***less wait time for me !
source***Horrible food and Horrible service .
source***To begin , we were told there was a 30 minute wait and started to leave , when the hostess offered to call us on our cell phone when the table was ready .
target***I wanted to purchase the extended warranty and they refused , because they knew it was trouble .
target***Best Buy was great as always and accepted the return and gave me another model 1764 .
target***Do n't get me wrong , I am no Microsoft hater , I ' ve just managed to turn into a much bigger Apple fan because of this machine .
source***That 's good and bad .
source***The only thing the waiters do n't do for you is wipe your chin when you leave .
target***The Apple team also assists you very nicely when choosing which computer is right for you ,
source***Great for groups , great for a date , great for early brunch or a nightcap .
source***It is nearly impossible to get a table , so if you ever have the chance to go here for dinner , DO NOT pass it up .
target***Another included program that is laughable is the chess game .
source***Even after getting pushed out by the no - class Famous Ray 's , Sal has risen again to carry on his father 's uncle 's legacies with a smile , true love for his community , and let 's not forget the Outstanding Pizza !
source***Stuffing yourself with Japanese food is a rare thing .
target***Will certainly use MacConnection again .
source***The prices can not be beat for the quality , quantity , freshness and taste .
target***Screen is awesome , battery life is good .
target***I had my IWORKS , Itunes , Email , MS Office , network and printers set up and completely working perfectly within an hour .
source***The rice to fish ration was also good -- they did n't try to overpack the rice .
target***I also had a problem with the touchpad that caused the mouse pointer to jump all over the screen .
target***the mouse on the pad , the left button always sticks .
source***We also had shared a house salad that was fresh .
target***I am very happy with this laptop .
target***This is another reason to like the Mac .
source***Nobody at this restaurant will give firm answers about anything and in the end , not one person takes responsibility for anything .
target***This causes my wrist to scrape up against it .
target***What I 'd like is for the laptop to run well without having to purchase additional memory .
target***Hewlett Packard HP Pavillion DV6000 Laptop is the worst laptop we have ever bought .
target***No problem with the ordering or shipping by the way .
target***Overall , still a very nice machine .
target***I could have purchased a cheap computer to do what I ' m doing now !
target***The Final Cut Pro on this laptop is so fast and easy , and I can use this to seemlessly transfer all my work to my home computer , which is also a mac .
target***There s always something wrong with it , wether it be some virus you ca n't track down , or it overheats , sometimes even catches on fire , you just ca n't use it .
target***After looking at all the pros and cons , I decided on the Macbook Pro .
source***The decor in this place is very diner - ish and the kind of place you expect in the East Village , not romantic , just simple , small and sparse .
target***Almost 4 years ago I bought what was then the current , up to date HP Pavilion -- If I recall correctly , it was the dv 1300 t .
source***i ' ve been back to nha trang literally a hundred times for the beef cubes , they 're that good .
source***Highly Highly Highly recommended !
target***The store honored their warrenty and made the comment that they do n't even recommend the HP brand because of the problems with their warrenty .
target***It is so speedy .
source***I live in the neighborhood and my friends meet me down here not only for the bar scene but also the promise of The Pizza Place at 3 am .
source***I ' ve been to several places for Dim Sum and this has got to be the WORST .
source***came here for restaurant week , did n't save much , but it was still great .
target***-Stay away from MacHouse Amsterdam .
target***I have had no luck with staples or HP to resolve this problem .
target***I initially purchased my Macbook Pro 13 in April , and I loved it .
source***They also do a great job for restaurant week .
source***I read the other review and have to say I had the opposite experience here last Sunday .
target***Because we did not purchase the extended warranty in time , we are on the hook for the repair .
source***Service could be improved but overall this is a place that understands the importance of little things the heavy , black , antique - seeming teapot , for one in the restaurant experience .
source***Restaurant snobs need not bother , this is a small , neighborhood kind of place .
source***i do n't usually order wine with indian so i ca n't comment on their wine list or their wine .
target***4 Laptop still did not work , blue screen within a week .
source***The crackling calamari salad , which is usually a cheap disaster at many restaurants , is crispy and lightly dressed .
source***A little overpriced but worth it once you take a bite .
source***Seating is ok even though sometimes there 's alot of people .
source***I heartily recommend .
target***THIS IS MY SECOND MAC BOOK PRO .
source***But this place is a well - oiled machine so they know what they 're doing .
target***Once again apple stands alone at the top of the charts .
source***The photobook menu was a cute touch , certainly helped my group and I pick the fried chicken , pork chop , and noodle dishes that we all ordered .
source***and there 's no way out .
target***It is so great , I can Hardly ever take my hands off it !
target***Charger seems large for this class of computer .
source***Was surprisingly disappointed .
source***It takes forever to get a drink and they almost always forget to bring something although they do n't forget to charge you for it .
target***I was even able to uninstall McAffe and install one of my Symantec licenses with a no issues whatsoever .
target***Enjoy your sitdown
source***To celebrate a birthday , three of us went to Mare anticipating great food .
target***The reflectiveness of the display is only a minor inconvenience if you work in a controlled - lighting environment like me I prefer it dark or if you can crank up the brightness .
source***Everything , from the soft bread , soggy salad , and 50 minute wait time , with an incredibly rude service to deliver below average food .
source***This is definitely an excellent date spot because of the ambiance and on the weekends the night scene is more than alive .
target***I sent it back AND THEY LOST IT .
source***I visit New Green Bo when I have money or when I am broke .
source***No one asked what was wrong as we left with nothing touched on our plates .
target***After 2 months of complaints , Asus finally sent the right power supply to my techies .
target***So think about factoring those things in when you purchase .
source***We will return many times for this oasis in mid - town .
source***Everyone I bring here always loves it .
target***The laptop is gorgeous .
source***The service was impeccable and unobtrusive - the staff knows what they are there to do - to know their menu , present your meal , and attend to your needs .
target***There s also iDVD , a program dedicated to putting all your favorite media together photos , recordings , video projects into one program so that you can create the perfect memoir for your parents , family , siblings , and any other person important in your life that there may be .
source***I love going there !
target***Also , the space bar makes a noisy click every time you use it .
source***The neighborhood was nice though so check out another restaurant instead .
source***There is a downside if you 're ordering in - the delivery guys have MAJOR attitude .
source***uni from maine vs california , sea vs freshwater eel to get a good taste comparison .
target***You will fall in love with it in no time .
target***I had to call Apple 19 times each time 40 to 75 minutes on the phone , and take it to their store for evaluations , and diagnostics , 5 times .
target***This is a great value for the money .
target***they improved nothing else such as Resolution , appearance , cooling system , graphics card , etc .
source***Service was prompt and courteous .
target***I have a business website and every time I have to change something I have to go to the public library to use a PC .
source***And all of that wo n't break your bank !
target***There also seemed to be a problem with the hard disc as certain times windows loads but claims to not be able to find any drivers or files .
target***I look forward to years of use , it has held up well over the years and it fits my needs very well .
source***i would just ask for no oil next time .
source***We ate at this Thai place following the reviews but very unhappy with the foods .
source***A must for all the Dosa lovers .
source***I ' ve been here a couple of times and have not been impressed .
source***The bread is the soft paratha bread unlike the plain bread they use in Calcutta , and the stuffing is tandoori styled and very flavorful .
source***The chicken and steak were seasoned and cooked to perfection , and the lamb sandwhich is great for heartier appetites .
source***The atmosphere is great ! ! !
target***I will never purchase a HP again ever .
source***An excellent service
target***It is not even a year old yet , so I would definitely not recommend it to anyone .
target***I ca n't honestly say I was heartbroken .
source***I ' ve been eating at Taj Mahal for over twenty years and have found them to be the most excellent of the Indian eateries on this block of Indian restaurants .
target***The graphics are stunning .
target***The right speaker did not work .
source***Will never be back .
target***I ' ve had hp desktop for over 4 yrs now and not one days goes by that i do n't regret buying it .
target***Great pick for portability and affordability .
target***I thought learning the Mac OS would be hard , but it is easily picked up if you are familiar with a PC .
source***The Thai ice tea was amazingly smooth and yummy !
target***THE FIRST PROBLEM IS THAT THE KEYBOARD FUNCTION IS SIMPLY UNSATISFACTORY .
source***I ' ve overheard comments from him to his employees that should not have been delivered in the dining area and I ' ve been sitting there while he lectured another customer .
source***my picks are , , Scallion Pancake fried with vegetable juice , very special and tasty , Guizhou Chicken , Shredded Squid Family Style one of my personal favorites , Sichuan Spicy Soft Shell Crab , Shuizhu Fish this one is for hardcore Sichuan food fans , I would n't recommend to my American friends as it 's very spicy .
source***Great pizza for lunch place .
target***Setting would change for some reason , the screen size would change on it 's own , like the pixel sizes and whatnot .
target***I am able to play 720p and 1080p media files just fine with it .
source***The rest of the menu is limited by everything is good eats .
source***They should have called it mascarpone with chocolate chips - good but a far cry from what the name implies .
source***In fact , while leaving the place we saw two people looking at the menu , and I could n't help telling them that the food was horrible .
target***I ' m hoping that I can find a really quick way to clean it without it getting too gross .
source***Service was very prompt but slightly rushed .
source***Food is excellent .
source***I would highly recommend .
source***Sure , everyone 's got their favorite , but to know Sal , is to know New York .
target***Oh yea , has no numeric pad on the side .
source***He has visited Thailand and is quite expert on the cuisine .
target***You just lose a customer .
source***Cozy romantic atomosphere with only around 15 tables at most .
source***Never fails to please .
source***Deff recimmend Bukhara they also have opened two new locations guess ill try them out .
target***the mouse buttons are hard to push .
target***Most everything is fine with this machine , speed , capacity , build .
target***Another thing I might add is the battery life is excellent .
target***I normally do n't participate in reviews / surveys but this laptop has not given me any problems and hope to share my thoughts .
source***This is such a lovely , peaceful place to eat outside .
target***This system came loaded with Windows 7 Starter .
target***Downfalls , sharp edges .
source***Food was good not great not worth the wait or another visit
source***I have tried to make reservations , but both times , the hostess did n't have my name .
source***In terms of the food itself - nothing special , we limited ourselves to several appetizers .
source***Enjoy ! ! !
target***But it may be potentially hundreds or thousands in the near future .
target***It does not keep internet signals no matter where you bring it .
target***It 's like 9 punds , but if you can look past it , it 's GREAT !
target***Hard disk , The new editions gives you more hard disk space 500 GB instead of 320 GB but time has taught me never to trust an internal hard disk .
target***I also liked the glass screen .
source***LOVE the atmosphere , felt like I was in Paris .
target***It pretty much does everything we could ever need , and looks great to boot .
source***Drinks got screwed up , she acted put upon .
target***I wanted to spend around $ 700 to $ 800 so I was directed to a nice looking HP Laptop .
source***I ' m happy to have Nosh in the neighborhood and the food is very comforting .
source***I came here for my friend 's birthday and keep coming back ever since .
source***Regardless of whether there are two people or two hundred people ahead of you the hostess will take your name and tell you Five minutes .
source***Would definitely go back again .
target***ASUS has done an outstanding job of evolving their netbooks , and I would recommend this to anyone who both understands their needs and how netbooks can fit them .
source***And you 're hungry a few hours later .
target***it is of high quality , has a killer GUI , is extremely stable , is highly expandable , is bundled with lots of very good applications , is easy to use , and is absolutely gorgeous .
source***The staff is n't the friendliest or most competent , and I am stickler for service , but everything else about this place makes up for it .
source***The service is a bit slow , but harkens back to my years growing up in Napoli , Italy where things are not rushed and when you sit down for dinner the table is yours all night .
source***and we were thouroughly disapointed .
target***Just a black screen !
source***You can get an excellent meal at most of the many Indian restaurants on nearby Lexington Avenue for the cost of one the dainty dishes here .
source***However , their popularity has yet to slow down , and I still find myself drawn to their ambiance and delectable reputation .
target***I have found a lot of online sources to help me but think that I would have learned a lot quicker if I would have taken the class .
target***I also like the acer arcade but these were reallythe only two things I liked about this laptop .
source***If it is n't for the food A+++ , it must be the service or the ambience .
target***Returning this as soon as I get out of work
source***Moderate prices .
source***Decor is nice though service can be spotty .
target***For the not so good , I got the stock screen , which is VERY glossy .
source***The owners and employees are friendly and their pizza is fantastic .
source***The food is tasty and portion sizes are appropriate .
source***The dim sum is ok but does n't taste that fresh , and the little dishes do n't look steamy hot as they should also note lack of Chinese here .
target***Well , I bought this laptop a month or two ago .
target***Look up recipes and keep it on the kitchen counter while I cook .
target***Now I could get myself a cheap computer , that will probably work a whole lot better !
target***The abuse is that I pushed the power plug in too hard .
target***I am very happy I bought this Mac , well worth the extra money .
target***I m very happy with this computer !
target***You might think , I am new in this game , but I am a gadget lover , and have had more than 2 dozens laptops in the past 15 years , and none gets this hot , that fast .
target***I wish it had a webcam though , then it would be perfect !
source***This is my first time writing a review for a restaurant because the food and service was excellent .
target***Good luck .
source***I was turned on to this restaurant by a fellow foodie friend of mine , and have been going back regularly ever since .
source***They do cater to American palates , but if you like it hot let them know and they are more than willing to oblige !
target***I love WIndows 7 which is a vast improvment over Vista .
target***I 'll wait and save up for a new one .
source***The owner truly caters to all your needs .
target***They were able to set - up with labtops themselves within a few minutes .
target***They refuse .
target***They are n't worth the money , even though they are on the cheap side , laptop speaking .
target***That system is fixed .
source***We had crawfish boiled and despite making a mess , it was a ton of fun and quite tasty as well .
source***They brought glasses and the bottle , and just left the bottle at our table .
target**** 5 weeks after giving the computer for repair*-Apple offers to send replacement after they receive the old computer .
source***It 's super - trendy and there 's always someone to take that empty seat , so it seems that customer service has been deemed not of the essence .
target***And I ' m still paying the bloody financing , for a product which did n't last me at least three years !
target***When I got this laptop in 2007 to help me with school , I had a hard time from beginning .
source***I have been to Casimir over 5 times and I have always had a great time there .
source***Super friendly and knowledgable staff , fabulous bistro fare and a wonderful jazz brunch with great live jazz the chilaquiles were awesome !
target***it has had some problems .
target***It is a cheap throw together .
target***This purchase opened me to the world of Macbooks , and I am impressed with the intuition of the design , the beauty of the product , and the excellent technological advances associated with it .
source***The octopus eaters were floored by the Octopus salad .
target***Next , most Acer laptop fans are on the bottom which is right on your laptop .
target***The people there just changed for me on the spot and I got a new arm piece and they did n't even request for a receipt .
source***i would recommend reservations on weekends though .
source***Ess - A - Bagel either by Sty - town or midtown is by far the best bagel in NY .
source***Service is friendly , prices are good , delivery time was a little slow , but for the way this pizza tastes , I ' m willing to overlook it .
target***I had meant to purchase the NB205 and bought this one by accident long story .
target***So what if the laptops / mobile phones look chic and cool ? The after sales support is terrible .
target***While lacking some of the functions of the other versions , this was very acceptable for the uses planned for this computer .
target***The screen gets smeary and dusty very quickly and it 's very noticeable .
source***first it took us a long time to find the place .
target***Will not buy another Toshiba , this is my second , not happy w/ either .
target***Most of the large bags are for a 17 inch .
source***The main course had an average portion , and was decent overall .
target***I loaded windows 7 via Bootcamp and it works flawlessly !
target***NOT WITH APPLE .
target***My power supply cord developed exposed wires within the first year of ownership , so it was covered by the Applecare warranty plan .
source***It wo n't break the bank but I also would n't come back for the food .
target***It was loaded with Windows Vista Home Premium -- delivered with only 1 GB of RAM , and it was a * dog * .
source***my picks , Guizhou chicken , fish with hot bean source , fish fillet in spicy source special menu .
source***i have eaten here a handful of times , for no reason besides sheer convenience .
target***I can see why the have soooo much money .
source***Not worth it .
target***We upgraded the memory to four gigabytes in order to take advantage of the performace increase in speed .
source***Looking from the outside in , one would hesitate to enter this hole in the wall really , that 's what it is .
target***Beta had better quality , but VHS became the industry standard .
source***HIGHLY RECOMMENDED for a first date .
target***I am definitely sold , and not going back to PCs for home use !
target***So far , I have no complaints .
source***JUST AWSOME .
source***When we were finally seated our waitress came by twice-1 for our order and 2-for our check .
target***I have had nothing but problems since the day I took it out of the box !
target***And that was the fourth time i ve sent it to them to get fixed .
source***I never had anything I did n't like here .
source***The hanger steak was like rubber and the tuna was flavorless not to mention it tasted like it had just been thawed .
source***Ca n't wait wait for my next visit .
target***If you check you will find the same notebook with the above missing ports and a dual core AMD or Intel processor .
source***Ok , for all of us growing up in the Village of NYC , we have spoiled by a plethora of restaurants , most of which stay open very late .
target***I can not be happier with the service or product .
target***The only thing that is n't perfect about this netbook is the speakers , they are not loud at all but I expected that .
target***Windows Vista makes this computer almost unusable for online service .
source***The last two times I ordered from here my food was soo spicy that I could barely eat it , and the spice took away from the flavor of the dish .
target***Can listen to my music and watch my videos with ease and with a great display .
target***I upgraded the memory and replaced the base Windows 7 Starter to Win 7 Home , and it runs just fine .
source***This was the perfect quiet , relaxing , and delicious accompaniment to our afternoon of theater .
target***It is a bit heavy .
target***The one down side to it is that when I play a certin game on here , it tends to freeze up sometimes , but that s the only bad thing about this computer .
source***This is a true gem of the village .
source***Though the Spider Roll may look like a challenge to eat , with soft shell crab hanging out of the roll , it is well worth the price you pay for them .
source***They are still living in the dark ages and do not have an answering machine , so if you want to make a reservation you are limited .
target***With a mac you do n't have to worry about antivirus software or firewall , it 's so wonderful .
target***The only problems are the sound is nt very loud I have to wear headphones .
source***And even with it 's Pub atmosphere they were great to my kids too !
target***it has times were it freezes for 10 seconds and then starts again .
target***Good laptop for the money .
target***I got the blue screen of death the first month I got it .
target***The much lauded combined touch pad and clicker is a nightmare .
target***HELP , HELP , OTHER THAN THAT GETS A GREAT LITTLE WONDER .
target***They sent out the box right away for me to send in my computer , they paid postage and whatnot , but when I got my computer back it still was n't running right , and now my CD drive was n't reading anything !
source***The appetizing is excellent , just as good as Zabars Barney Greengrass at a reasonable price if bought by the pound .
target***They said that my computer was covered on an extended warranty , and that products with extended warranties are taken care of through third parties and not Sony itself anymore .
source***Oh , do n't even let me start with how expensive the bills were !
source***I came to this restaurant expecting to be surprised but left bored and overcharged .
source***The vibe is very relaxed and cozy , service was great and the food was excellent !
target***We purchased this as a back up computer after our more expensive HP needed to be repaired .
target***the key bindings take a little getting used to , but have loved the Macbook Pro .
target***It did n't take me long to get switched over to the Mac computer programs and navigation , it 's been just fine and like the way this laptop functions much better .
source***I can not imagine you not rushing out to eat there .
target***Simply amazing computer ! !
target***The repairs were made quickly though I must say , however the second time they shipped it to the incorrect address and it took nearly a week for them to get it to me .
source***I am so coming back here again , as much as I can .
source***Metrazur has a beautiful spot overlooking the main terminal .
target***Although i do believe that Windows operating system may be to fault for some of the problems .
target***Do I like the computer ? Well , other than not getting viruses , I guess it is OK .
target***i ca n't believe HP put this out .
source***The flavors are very fresh and pretty inobtrusive , nothing flashy .
source***No plans to return anytime soon .
source***I go twice a month !
target***They 're not safe , they 're not durable , they just a worthless .
target***What 's really great about this product is you may have a family member who is computer illiterate and you can pretty much just let them loose on this computer without any real supervision .
source***They kindly brought us more to see if it was better , but it was not !
source***Not enough wines by the glass either .
target***If you can afford a new laptop , and are in the market for one , of course , then definitely go for this .
target***The mousepad is a huge pain in the arse !
source***black white shakes came out good also .
target***I have used different laptops in the past and I have to rate this one way above the rest .
target***It allows you to automatically upload photos to your Facebook account with one click .
target***-Computer crashed frequently and battery life decreased very quickly .
source***The food is expensive , but worth every bite .
target***Not easy to carry .
target***I like it !
target***I previously owned an HP desktop and a Dell laptop .
source***If that 's a problem , go to McDonald 's and destroy your insides .
target***The image is great , and the soud is excelent .
source***Simple comfort food and what hot and lage portions .
source***They have authentic Indian at amazin prices .
target***My next laptop will also be a Mac !
target***Love it .
target***It 's so bad that I ' m thinking I only got half a battery or something .
target***I do everything on this computer , check email , facebook , shop , check blogs , write papers , listen to music , and we even watch all of our movies on it since we do not have a tv .
target***If I had to buy another computer , I would most definetly buy an acer one computer .
target***The dv4 boasted a faster processor , more memory , and a bigger hard drive than my old computer , plus a better quality web cam , nicer screen , and many other features .
source***I highly recommend the Sophia pizza .
source***We even had a visit from the Manager who wanted to make sure we were enjoying ourselves .
source***Truly the mark of an attentive waiter .
source***The food is okay and the prices here are mediocre .
source***delicious .
source***Pick a bagel has the best bagels in the city .
source***I highly recommend Cafe St Bart 's for their food , the ambience and wonderful service .
target***I ' m all for saving money but Dell needs to step it up .
target***That 's very possible , but since they do n't make Windows XP drivers for the sound card in this machine , I was stuck until Windows 7 came out .
source***The pizza is yummy and I like the atmoshpere .
target***On 3 July 2004 , I purcased this model at Best Buy for about $ 150
target***Also , the extended warranty was a problem .
target***Ca n't wait until I go on vacation and take it with me .
target***In short , you could say your mac could become your best friend no intention of replacing Rover your dog .
source***The service , however , was a bright flower in a garden .
source***Ingredients are organic which is a real plus for me .
source***I loved it .
target***This machine delivers .
source***All of my co - workers stated that the food was amazing and wondered why they had n't heard about this place .
source***After complaining about the chicken dish , the manager came over to tell us that , no one had ever complained before , and that we just did n't know what the dish was supposed to taste like .
target***Then after paying for it to be examined I was told it was same problem cited on website but I 'd have to pay anyways since it was past warrenty .
source***Try green curry with vegetables .
source***Service was prompt , friendly and great .
source***Emilio , the owner , is often sitting in the front table greeting guests as they come and go .
source***That place was awesome , , , sally !
source***DO not try unless you 're just going there to hang out like the rest of the hipsters who apparently have no sense of taste .
target***The only bad thing about it is they give you the worst batteries possible .
source***Sake collection was excellent Try Nanbu Bijin , but pricy .
target***they respond , your dissatisfaction is noted .
target***They gave me a hard time yet again , but their was a malfunction in the battery itself , it did n't die .
target***So far so good with this laptop .
source***The takeout is great too since they give high quality tupperware as well .
target***This is my second MACBOOK PRO and it 's better than ever .
target***No big deal .
target***Taking it back to Best Buy I found that a tiny plastic piece inside had broken manuf issue .
target***It is by far one of the greatest investments I have ever made .
source***Especially liked chicken tikka and the naan , and the dals .
target***I have found also , it is very easy to be able to access wireless internet access ;
target***Microsoft word was not on it andI had to buy it seperately .
target***-Managed to send complaint email .
source***Among all of the new 5th avenue restaurants , this offers by far one of the best values for your money .
target***The keyboard is slick and quiet and not bulky like some other laptops I have had in the past .
target***I purchased an HP right after my high school graduation .
source***Saul is pretty good , but definitely not great .
target***I could save ten essay papers and have hardly any memory left .
source***THe back garden sitting area is very pleasant , where you can see their personal herb garden .
source***Also , the sandwiches nearing $ 7 did n't come with anything like chips or a side .
source***It 's only $ 195 for a regular slice and $ 400 for a slice with a mushroom , not mushrooms .
source***Waiters tend to forget drinks completely , food portions are so tiny , two people have trouble sharing one entree .
target***Its hard to encounter a problem on a mac that would require such abrupt action .
target***Great , quick laptop for the money .
source***Even my Indian friend could n't believe how good and tasty everything was .
target***Screen , keyboard , and mouse , If you ca n't see yourself spending the extra money to jump up to a Mac the beautiful screen , responsive island backlit keyboard , and fun multi - touch mouse is worth the extra money to me alone .
source***I choose to go with one of the special , the braised lamb shank in red wine , which was excellent .
source***we love th pink pony .
source***So , a little inconsistency there but either way , both pizzas were really good .
target***There 's literally no way to make it sing with Vista .
source***Meanwhile , the bartender continued to pour champagne from his reserve after we had finished our bottle and we enjoyed an amuse of turnip soup with pureed basil , gratis .
target***I would definitely not go back to using a PC after using the mac .
source***I ate here for the first time and absolutely loved it !
target***I was loving this Netbook because it had an amazing screen and display and was small and light , but after 1 week it stopped openning web pages for me even after installing new browsers then eventually it just started giving me a blue screen and crashing everytime I booted it .
source***We all felt it was worth it .
target***the only down fall is that it has no cd drive but i found that they are very cheap to by and also very portable making this the best friend to someone who is always looking for more space then they have .
source***Service is highly refined , our seating was delayed 35 minutes past our reservation and the maitre d apologized and regularly kept us apprised of progress .
source***So rude .
source***Try the chocolate mud cake ( warmed ) with 2 scoops of dulce de leche gelato .
target***I would Highly recommend this MacBook .
source***This place is a great bargain .
target***dell is a decently made pc .
target***the features are great , the only thing it needs is better speakers .
target***With notes saying they replaced the hard drive .
source***The prices and ambience are especially great considering it 's in the West Village .
source***It 's great to go for a quick lunch either alone or with a friend .
target***I should have sent it back to them then .
source***Quick and friendly service .
target***The graphics on this computer are also stellar , very clear and vivid .
source***Great bar , most gorgeous bar you ' ve ever seen specifically the blond lady .
source***The place is a little tight and on a cold day , the seating by the entranceway can be pretty drafty .
target***I also enjoy the fact that my MacBook Pro laptop allows me to run Windows 7 on it by using the VMWare program .
source***The in - house lady DJ on Saturday nights has outrageously good taste in music , and moreover , takes requests .
target***So you out of of notebook and money .
target***WHEN TYPING , LETTERS AND SPACES ARE FREQUENTLY OMITTED REQUIRING THE USER TO REDO MANY WORDS AND SENTENCES .
target***It 's so much easier to navigate through the operating system , to find files , and it runs a lot faster !
target***I would recommend anyone to buy from pcconnection express .
target***It has been nothing but trouble from the time we bought it .
target***Its a dog plain and simple .
source***If you wrote a bad review , it 's because you do n't understand what Rao 's is all about .
target***I could n't believe how long the battery lasted on a single charge .
source***Chance is a small cozy restaurant , with a romantic feel to it , the decor is great .
source***The tuna and wasabe potatoes are excellent .
target***The screen graphics and clarity , and sharpness are great .
target***My first problem was with the pre - loaded Norton Firewall / Security program .
source***The waitstaff were attentive , polite and helpful , an impressive feat in such close quarters .
target***The Aspire wo nt even boot past the Acer screen with a Droid I have tried both Motorola and HTC plugged into the USB port .
source***Raga stands out with an interesting fusion of French and Indian cooking .
source***The ambience is very calm and quiet .
target***Lord HAVE MERCY !
target***Being a PC user my whole life .
target***All I can say is W - O - W .
source***I would say that all was fine and tasty but the heaviness on my stomach someting that i ca n't not mention or undermine .
target***the only problem is that i had to add 1 gb RAM , the computer was kinda slow .
target***Its fast and another thing I like is that it has three USB ports .
source***I LOVED THE SHOWS .
target***If the number of patrons in the Apple store are any indication , HP and other PC manufacturers need to take note .
target***I have a laptop as my regular computer , but found that disconnecting it and lugging it around was a drag .
target***Do yourself a favor , this is not a fake story trying to hurt alienware .
target***The netbook is easier for me to take to bed and carry around with me .
target***I spent alot of money on this product and its been a nightmare .
source***My wife and I also enjoyed the spinach , the Shanghai low mein , and other attractions .
source***The food was pretty good , but a little flavorless and the portions very small , including dessert .
target***Much of which HP ended up paying for .
target***I should have realized that trouble was brewing .
source***I would never wait for a table to eat , it just is not THAT great .
target***I called their repair depot as was told they would send Me a new box to return the computer to the repair depot .
source***Awsome Pizza especially the Margheritta slice .
source***You are treated just like royality .
target***Mom , Dad , Brother , sister , You name it !
target***I should have kept my big , old HP .
source***If you are someone who appreciates simplicity , elegance , and wonderfully presented and tasting seafood and vegetables regardless of portion size , Kai is your place .
target***Second , it gets scratches easily and when it gets old some thing may operated
target***Anyone who is considering buying an Acer computer of any sort , I seriously suggest you look into buying a different brand .
source***If you 're in town , it 's worth searching for another place .
source***They do n't walk around with the trays of Dim Sum .
target***I took the computer into Best Buy where I purchased it and they kept it over night to study it .
source***Interesting other dishes for a change include chicken in curry sauc and salmon caserole .
source***A very inviting restaurant , with friendly service .
target***I had to have these computers in my school .
target***But if you ca n't make your product last more than a year , you will not get my business again .
source***Best of all is the warm vibe , the owner is super friendly and service is fast .
target***The resolution is even higher then any other laptop on the market .
target***Seems to slow down occassionally but can run many applications ie Internet tabs , programs , etc simultaneously .
target***Either way I ' m furious .
source***Then , IF they answer the phone , you 're lucky if they do n't hang up on you !
source***Not sure where the previous reviewer , lonk , dined , but Saul is in a great neighborhood and has great food !
source***It might have been a little too spicy for my friend , which you can couteract with eat more rice and keeping water on hand .
source***It 's charmingly small and that leads to an atmoshere that is extremely cozy and romantic , even .
source***The food was delicious but do not come here on a empty stomach .
source***Make sure you have the Spicy Scallop roll .
source***This little place definitely exceeded my expectations and you sure get a lot of food for your money .
target***I managed to comply with these too and now have to wait and see if they can find another way to screw me .
target***The Bluetooth was not there at all , and the fingerprint reader driver would be there , but the software would hang after installation was 1/2 way done .
source***Glad you have the luxury to throw out paying customers .
target***I brought this laptop last friday , and originally it worked fantastic .
target***It is not ideal for children because of the temp .
source***You will pay a lot for the decore , but the food is no better or worse than a lot of other Chinese and Asian fusion places in NY .
target***I did n't want to buy a generic brand computer but it is really nice .
target***I believe I purchased this in Dec 09 for my primary work laptop which is used 5 - 10 hours a day , 4 - 6 days a week .
target***my information was all lost my fault , I know , but I never thought I would need to back up my information on a brand new Mac , the paragon of all computers !
source***We had a most unpleasant experience at this restaurant .
target***Every driver on the driver DVD is everything you will need for a reload .
target***This laptop looks great on the surface , 17 " inch screen , good price - point , nice appearance , boots up quickly , runs fast etc .
source***Good French restaurant in an area devoid of decent restaurants unless you 're into eating 4 pound pastrami sandwiches at Katz Deli , or Mexican food which is supplied by capable restaurants .
source***All I can say is $ 2 pints during happy hour and the some of the cheapest oysters you 'll find in the city , though the quality is some of the best .
target***Images can be multi - selected and viewed swiftly or in slideshow mode .
source***Definitely a great spot for a nice occasion or date .
source***Staffs are not that friendly , but the taste covers all .
source***The food was amazing , the service was so attentive and personable , and how about that ambience !
source***Stay away from the latter since you wo n't go for seconds hint hint .
source***They ' ve the best desserts and mixed drinks as well as snack foods .
source***Always great service !
target***They 're easy , fun , powerful and will last a long time .
source***Ruby Foo 's is a tourist trap .
target***Programs would crash all the time , and it turned out to be a very unstable , unreliable laptop for me .
target***I ' ve been having endless problems since I bought the computer , only 1 month ago
target***There are so many wonderful features and benefits to the new MacBook !
source***Waitstaff is great , very attentive .
source***Once you become a regular , you are treated as one .
source***I would n't mind going back some time , but not before trying others nearby .
source***A word to the wise , the Hoboken health inspector clued me to his findings that this is THE cleanest restaurant in town .
target***Needs constant repair .
target***so in a brief summary i would have to say that i would not recommend dell vostro 1000 to anyone due to it being a down right awful setup so in my opinion you should steer clear of them if you want a decent laptop .
target***But if you are in the computer field you probably would n't be here .
target***All the yada - yada .
source***Prices are in line .
target***But with A WAY Bigger Screen , and IS able to connect to an HDMI .
target***Also , you wo n't have to worry about them going onlne a getting a virus .
target***Not to mention it has shit gigs .
source***La Rosa waltzes in , and I think they are doing it the best .
target***I took off a star because the machine has a lot of junk software on it .
target***I ' m making the switch and finding that my biggest problem is trying to do things the old way , and Apple does , indeed , have the better idea .
target***I returned it to Best Buy on the ninteenth of April .
target***I do find that my MacBook has a lot more bells and whistles than a normal PC especially if you enjoy technology , downloading pictures and graphic design .
source***They are served with a free appetizer and the portions are perfect for lunch .
target***Other than that I do n't have one complaint in the world !
target***When I turned it on , nothing .
source***I grew up eating Dosa and have yet to find a place in NY to satisfy my taste buds .
target***pros , the macbook pro notebook has a large battery life and you wo nt have to worry to charge your laptop every five hours or so .
source***All the desserts the group tried got favorable reviews .
source***Finally , after all the raving I went to check it out with one of my enthusiastic friends this last Saturday night and let me tell you its all its cracked up to be .
target***The mouse is a little bit different than what you 're used to though it has one big flat panel and one full bar instead of two separate ones to click with but you get used to it quite quickly .
target***The price was very good , and the product is top quality .
source***Our waitress was sweet and accomodating , not overbearing .
source***Moules were excellent , lobster ravioli was VERY salty !
target***The display is beyond horrible .
source***Besides having the table we had been promised given to other restaurant patrons twice before we were actually seated , we were served dishes we had n't ordered three times , received one of our orders 20 minutes after the rest of the table had been served and that order was undercooked , and charged $ 45 more than we should have been on our bill .
target***I like this machine because its very lightweight .
source***Decor is charming .
source***In any event , this is a place I 'll be sure to stop by again when I ' m in this part of town .
target***I finally decided on this laptop because it was the right price for what I need it .
source***If you 'd like to have a nice light meal with an asian accent , Long Tan is a good place on the slope .
source***With the theater 2 blocks away we had a delicious meal in a beautiful room .
target***the headphone and mic jack are in front of touch - pad making the touch - pad hard to use when using headphone , not to mention the laptop was designed for right handed person .
target***A little pricey but it is well , well worth it .
source***we split a tasty vegetable samosa and the malai tikka wrap .
source***I love this place more and more everytime i go .
source***I am going to the mid town location next .
source***Worth visiting the 1st Ave spot because it is the original store .
source***Nice ambiance , nice little bar , good bar , Francois , and good service .
source***Just because it 's cheap does NOT mean the portions are small or the food is nasty , IT IS GREAT !
source***and i have been around the block , to say the very least .
source***The owner is very friendly and a great guy , go try his pizza , you 'll like it !
target***I took 3 - 4 years researching brands and prices of laptops .
source***There was a great deal for 6 Blue Point oysters and a beer or glass of wine for $ 8 !
source***This lovely French - Asian fusion restaurant stands out amongst other great restaurants on Smith Street .
target***Newegg 's RMA service was great as always , I contacted them late Friday night , and they issued me an RMA number and a PrePaid UPS shipping label the very next morning on Saturday .
target***My one complaint with this laptop is that I ' ve noticed an electronic fuzz sound coming out of the headphone jack when headphones are plugged in .
target***The OS takes some getting used to especially after being a Windows user for so long but the learning curve is so worth it !
source***The Prix Fixe menu is worth every penny and you get more than enough both in quantity AND quality .
source***Last time I went here , the waitress did n't come back after taking our order .
source***By far this is the only chinese desserts place I know in NY or anywhere close in the Northeastern America that serves desserts with frog jelly in a couple of varieties and pig feet ginger simmered in black vinegar .
target***If so , you may be having similar problems .
target***My ONLY issues are , 1 the screen / video resolution wo n't increase to a higher resolution then 1024 x 60
source***Here you get the zen feel without feeling rigid .
target***I reinstalled windows through the recovery discs and everything seemed good again .
source***$ 20 for all you can eat sushi can not be beaten .
source***At the end you 're left with a mild broth with noodles that you can slurp out of a cup .
target***We purchase the Dell XPS several years ago for my home business .
target***My sister has the same Mac as me and she is in a band and uses GarageBand to record and edit .
target***Now , the next issue I had freaked me out .
source***All the pastas are fantastic and the homemade lasagna is some of the best that I have had in the City .
source***Most of the servers are very attentive , friendly and quite attractive .
source***If you want Americanized Chinese food with your usual watery , generic white sauce , this is your place .
target***After doing CAD work all day at work , using a higher end PC , I could n't come home and settle for the use of a lower end computer .
source***The service was poor , restaurant poorly lit , staff not very attentive and I would have rather eaten at a Mcdonald 's than this joint .
source***My steak au poivre was one of the worst I ' ve had .
target***They did n't even try to assist me or even offer a replacement .
source***Service here was great , food was fantastic .
source***Other than the crappy service from two individuals , it 's great .
source***Only drawback , they wo n't toast your bagel , and they do n't make eggs for the bagel .
source***Succulent steaks cooked precisely to your desired doneness accompanied by salads and sides that do n't look like leafy road kill .
target***The keyboard feels good and I type just fine on it .
source***Apparently , the good cook works then .
source***The steak was very fatty and the sauce was overpowering and not very tasty .
source***Although the place could be a little more eye catching and roomier , at the same time , it does n't really matter .
source***It only took about five or so minutes to get an empty table , but standing up was n't too bad .
target***I would rather spend my money on a computer that costs more then a Toshiba that is n't good at all .
target***I am so happy to have purchased this computer .
target***Just a bunch of idiots who 's English as a 5th language is forced at best .
source***This is definitely a place that provides the best experience , though , to both A - listers and people walking in off the street .
source***After really enjoying ourselves at the bar we sat down at a table and had dinner .
target***I could n't afford a new mac , so I bought a PC instead .
target***while it was barely a bargin in the begining , i would never purchase another dell and would not recomend the dell brand to others .
target***it might be something deep within Windows , for I was unable to create a disk image on my hard drive .
target***I have full control at all times of what is going on , there is no control+alt+delete business anymore .
target***I charge it at night and skip taking the cord with me because of the good battery life .
source***Fast service .
target***I eventually did the migration from my iMac backup disc which uses USB .
target***It is stamped and not in pieces therefore it is a stronger more resilient frame .
source***But , nothing stands out about the cooking .
source***Service and food is what any one would expect when spending that type of money .
source***The food was average or above including some surprising tasty dishes .
source***They are not helpful in the least and will give you the grand run around so by the time the event date rolls around you will not only regret chosing this place , but also become hostile !
source***The hostess is rude to the point of being offensive .
target***Took the netbook on a vacation trip and I was able to do whatever I wanted to do without lugging a much heavier laptop .
target***The acer one computer that I bought is 17 ince screen and its hard to find lap top bags for it , but I like the big screen on it .
source***Oh , and the complimentary pudding dessert was just enough yummy !
source***LLOOVVE THIS PLACE .
target***I am currently out of town and called to inform them the broken part would be returned when I got back in town .
source***Staff is very accomodating .
source***The food is uniformly exceptional , with a very capable kitchen which will proudly whip up whatever you feel like eating , whether it 's on the menu or not .
target***The computer was delivered as promised .
target***This laptop is fast and you will literally learn all you can do with this dynamo by just watching the online tutorials .
target***Also , one of the users mentioned how the edges on the macbook is sharp , if you have money to spend on one of the incase shells , it does n't seem to be a problem .
source***Right off the L in Brooklyn this is a nice cozy place with good pizza .
target***Only a few days after I received the computer back , the screen froze again .
target***Graphics are clean and sharp , internet interfaces are seamless .
target***It drives me crazy when I want to download a game or something of that nature and I ca n't play it because its not compatable with the software .
source***Friendly staff that actually lets you enjoy your meal and the company you 're with .
source***I was back - to - back with the diner at the table behind me and wait staff had to hoist trays over our heads as they squeezed past us again and again .
target***Quality Display I was surprised with the performance and quality of this HP Laptop .
source***The waiters are sweet , the food is tasty and the bill is never too large .
target***I was getting extrememly frustrated when I would want to do these simple taks that I would have to wait and wait and wait for things to download or virus that would clog up my PC .
source***this little place has a cute interior decor and affordable city prices .
source***On a monthly basis my friends and I get together and have a girls night out .
target***If you buy , pray you do n't have major prolems .
source***I will definetely go back again and again , that 's for sure ! ! !
target***I ' ve have n't had any major problems with the laptop except that the plastic piece that covers the usb port wires have all come off .
source***For dinner I had the chicken tikka - masala and some garlic naan .
source***I felt as though I were eating in Paris .
target***The cool thing about this is anyone can use it .
target***I use this for my tutoring business , and since I ' m always bouncing from student to student , it is ideal for portability and battery life yes , it gets the 8 hours as advertised ! .
target***PDF files can be viewed instantly .
source***They 're are better Taiwanese restaurants and they are located in Flushing , Queens .
source***Bartender was unable to tear himself away from friends at bar .
source***The wait staff is very friendly , if not overly efficient .
source***If you want some roast duck , pork or chicken on rice with ginger , try them out !
target***So if you move laptop a lot , it might get loose , however it sits pretty tightly .
source***Food was OK , fish was cooked well .
source***He not only makes his own homemade mozzarella , but every pie is ultra fresh .
target***Accordingly , I have decided to NEVER purchase another HP product my five year old Compaq lasted 5-years before the hard drive crashed .
source***Its a go - to for dates as well as entertaining out of town guests .
target***It seems to have some opions that are intalled but do not work like I thought they would .
target***So I got another netbook which I love !
target***Frustrated I hung up and tried to call back 3 days later to be told that it takes 2 - 3 days for turnaround time .
target***I have had several machines over the years , both for personal and business use .
source***This restaurant is such a great place .
source***Not a typical pizza joint , but good for a low key and fairly cheap nice sit down dinner .
source***Dinner took almost 4 hours without any lag time .
target***I own a Hewlett Packard laptop and I ' ve had man problems with it since I bought in in Feb , 201
target***I preferred the fit and feel of the 13 inch .
target***I ' m an excellent touch typist , and my hands are very sensitive , too .
target***This is a review of windows vista system .
target***-Called headquarters again , they report that TFT panel is broken , should be fixed by the end of the week week 3 .
source***After a seafood craving , i checked citysearch and chose to go to Fish based on a previous review and the citysearch info .
target***I am not one to throw things like this around but it is a laptop so carrying it around does seem to mean it will be jerked possibly a little , while driving a car and carrying it into where ever you are using it .
target***Its still going .
target***This netbook went bad on me after 3 days .
source***I in all reality felt as if I had just gotten off Air France and was in the 8th District in Paris .
target***I noticed windows has a new system called Windows 7 , what about us Vista users ? They should get all the bugs out of Vista before investing in a new system .
target***in May I started having problems with the USB ports not working .
source***Try the tandoori salmon !
target***they have done absolutely nothing to fix the computer problem .
target***Keyboard is great but primary and secondary control buttons could be more durable .
target***I really wish I had done this years ago .
source***After reading the good reviews of this restaurant , I decided to give it a try with two friends .
target***It took Toshiba tech support 4 calls and 4 different techs to correct the problem .
source***The burger was great , also .
target***Guess I 'll stay away from HP .
target***It was kind of a rebellion against PC in fact , and I am certainly glad I did .
target***It 's also very energy efficient , running on a quarter of the power it takes to run a 60 Watt lightbulb .
target***I guess the only good thing that came out of these were the speakers and the subwoofer .
target***I bought a cordless mouse for it , but do n't always take it out ;
source***Not a great place for family or general dining .
source***Overall a disappointing experience for that price category .
target***To my mind much more usable than the toy called an IPad .
source***word of advice , save room for pasta dishes and never leave until you ' ve had the tiramisu .
source***The service was attentive .
source***Very good wine choices .
source***The white bean brushetta to start was incredible and the pasta was phenomenal .
source***However , I do not understand the extraordinary hype about this restaurant .
target***That was my first Apple product and since then I have been incredibly happy with every product of theirs I have bought .
target***My smart phone is faster !
target***The computer is currently in West Verginia doe to the method of shipping choosen by Toshiba .
source***Sushi was n't anything spectacular for the price .
source***Wondering who had the best deals we noticed a line had formed to wait for this one particular establishment .
target***Purchased for development purposes , but it has turned into my everyday laptop as well for surfing , e - mail , etc .
target***None of the techs at HP knew what they were doing .
target***I can leave my MacBook uncharged for upwards of eight hours and it wo n't even be dead .
target***It is held in place magnetically .
source***I usually go there later at night when I get off work so I do n't have to deal with crowds or lines .
source***I seriously doubt I will ever dine at Jimmy 's Bronx , or for that matter , Jimmy 's Uptown , again .
source***I ' m just reading some of these reviews and its nonsense that people are reviewing some places because it was too loud .
source***You should pass on the calamari .
target***Obviously one of the most important features of any computer is the human interface .
target***They are wonderful , but very dangerous when it comes to emitting heat .
source***If the omakase is to showcase technique and variety , serving almost 40 % of items BBQ - ed and a spicy tuna roll wrapped with not - so - fresh nori seems to be a rather limp performance .
target***Kind of annoying , but I still love the laptop .
target***I have never had it crash , randomly turn off
source***Just ignore the trendy wannabes .
target***Remember to do your research first before consider buying a toshiba product .
target***If only Bill Gates would read some of what is said here MS would do a better job .
source***The miso soup lacked flavor and the fish was unfortunately not as well prepared as in the past .
target***Probably as good as you can get in a netbook , does everything I ask for and has some very good unexpected pluses .
target***Another THREE weeks later I had my laptop back with a new mousepad , keys , and casing .
source***While we enjoyed the food , we were highly disappointed by the poor service waiter was not quite competent and SLOW service and lack of remorse .
target***As it turns out , I just did n't know any better .
source***after dining at BOG over twenty times now , its official ! .
target***Overall this laptop is great .
source***We were treated with attitude ever since the moment we stepped into the restaurant !
target***My review mainly talks about the difference I have felt between an early 2011 and late 2011 mac book pro .
target***Originally bought it for my wife .
target***A seventy dollar mouse !
source***The overall price tag was very very expensive , something I did expect .
target***If this would be your first Mac purchase then I would highly suggest that you take advantage of the class that they offer to learn about the differences between Mac and PC 's .
target***Plain and simple , itlaptop runs great and loads fast .
source***I was very disappointed with this restaurant .
source***Chow fun was dry ; pork shu mai was more than usually greasy and had to share a table with loud and rude family .
source***First , the waiter who served us neglected to fill us in on the specials , which I would have chosen had I known about them .
source***I ' ve read some of the previews reviews , people are either not New Yorkers or have more appreciation for ambience then food .
source***If you are a vegetarian , this really is n't a good place to go .
source***We could only get through an appetizer and cheese fondue .
target***The feel of this machine compared to the old MacBook is far superior .
target***The only thing is that the battery wo n't last more than 1/2 an hour .
source***For all you lazy folks that do n't want to come to Alphabet City , I say , good , stay out .
source***Surprisingly nothing could be further from the truth .
source***I really did n't know what to expect for a restaurant that literally overlooks the main hall of Grand Central .
target***Summary , Spend your money elsewhere
target***I was looking for a mac which is portable and has all the features that I was looking for .
target***I used to build my own desktops from the component parts , and recently my 7 year old Pentium 4 with HT 1 GB ram SATA desktop stopped working this was a rock star 7 years ago .
source***The only thing I could get attention from was one of at least two cats running around that kept batting at my table .
source***Just bring someone who speaks Cantonese because waiter may not understand you .
source***Last memorial day , I tried to make reservations but was told they were closed that weekend interesting , but .
target***the apple pro notebook will not let you down .
source***We always have a delicious meal and always leave feeling satisfied .
source***And everytime I go there 's a bunch of drunk idiots making a scene out front .
target***A cheaper price should not equal a cheap product .
source***I know because I live nearby .
target***Was not happy with one of the programs on it .
target***The start menu is not the easiest thing to navigate due to the stacking .
source***It is one the nicest outdoor restaurants I have ever seen in NY -- I am from Italy and this place rivals the ones in my country .
target***I purchased a Toshiba Satellite M60 with harman / kardon speakers ! in December of 2005 .
source***There was a small group of us looking somewhere to eat kinda late on a weeknight and we ended up at Pastis .
source***This place is to be avoided .
target***I enjoy very much my new Toshiba , purchased specifially for attending online schooling .
source***Its also a bit of a hassle to get to without a car I happen to live in Inwood .
source***The service was excellent and the food was delicious .
source***As many other reviewers noticed , your order is often slow to arrive , this is particularly true in the evening but is not a problem during lunch time .
source***An excellent alternative to fast food joints and ordering in but , the food was slightly disappointing .
source***He offers subpar service and has no personality .
source***Then , get ripped on free box wine .
source***Get your food to go , find a bench , and kick back with a plate of dumplings .
target***It 's a bummer and one out of five is being kind .
source***We visited Bread Bar during January restaurant week and were so pleased with the menu selections and service .
source***Everything is excellent , the menu is quite extensive , and you eat with a view on both sides of the city .
source***I thought going to Jimmys would give me a real Domincan exprience .
source***Having been a long time Ess - a - Bagel fan , I was surpised to find myself return time and time again to Murray 's .
target***The keyboard is top notch .
source***delicious simple food in nice outdoor atmosphere .
target***My laptop worked again for just a while before I started having issues AGAIN .
source***While the ambiance and atmosphere were great , the food and service could have been a lot better .
source***NO PIZZA 33 for me !
source***Unfortunately , the food is outstanding , but everything else about this restaurant is the pits .
target***My first laptop was an Acer that I got for Christmas .
target***It has just enough RAM to run smoothly and enough memory to satisfy my needs .
source***Great food , good size menu , great service and an unpretensious setting .
source***I ' ve been to this restaurant more than a dozen times and when I ' m craving for Pho , Lemon grass chicken or Beef Cube on rice , this is the place to go .
target***I loved it then , but unfortunately it was before the days of wireless internet .
source***You can do it here .
target***Maybe not the cutting edge Satellite L455D but it is a workhorse .
source***Great neighborhood joint .
source***This should have been done in a back room , away from customers .
source***We ate here in March , 2006 and ordered the pre - theatre 3-course dinner with wine flight .
target***I always use a backup hard disk to store important files at all times .
target***I bought this notebook and only had it for 3 months If it is overload with updates the BOOT MGR .
source***I ' ve been to Joya twice and I will never go again .
source***Beef noodle soup is good as well .
source***Definitely a neighborhood favorite .
target***I have had it 9 months and it is already a $ 250 loss .
source***Great service , great food .
source***The price very reasonable .
source***Went to Ottimo and was expecting outstanding pizza as I love La Pizza Fresca .
target***I was n't really sure I wanted to spend that kind of money !
source***The waitress was very patient with us and the food is phenomenal !
target***The graphics were awful and the warranty is n't even worth the cheap payment on the computer .
source***The sauces used are also not that exciting .
source***I go back in line like three times on average until I ca n't walk anymore .
target***-When I started worrying for not hearing anything from them , I tried to call .
source***Lunch came with pickels and slaw , no extra charge .
target***This computer had exactly the specifications I needed .
source***Do n't go .
source***I have been coming to this neighborhood spot for years .
target***But while this is one big advantage as you may know from the company s recent commercials there are other things to consider before going with Apple .
target***Very happy with my 7th Toshiba laptop !
source***Your friends will thank you for introducing them to this gem !
target***From the start , when you open the box you see a completely different class of machine .
target***The difference is the Toshiba had a lot more memory and hard drive space .
source***Also good for client lunch meetings , esp .
target***Love that it does n't take up space like a regular computer .
source***Ask for Usha , the nicest bartender in manhattan .
target***So what am I supposed to do ? The LG service center can not provide me the service when it is called the service center .
source***We had a girls night dinner here for restaurant week .
target***I sent it back to Toshiba twice they covered it under the warranty .
source***We have tried every Thai restaurant between Atlantic Avenue and 4th Streets , and Joya is the best .
source***There 's something smooth about sipping sake upper east side style .
source***from an English speaking staff .
target***And the warranty on this macbook pro can last up to 5 years or 1000 battery recharge cycles .
target***They discovered the manufacturer 's defect and sent it in for repair .
target***The speed gives you the power to work on these projects seamlessly , and multiple at a time if you sowish .
target***its not bad just VERY VERY annoying .
target***Then to make matters worst , there is noone that they can transfer you to .
source***Kind of a small place but I guess if they are not too busy might be able to fit a group or kids .
target***I ' m honestly afraid that it will burn me , it 's that hot !
source***We had the pot - stickers which were great and a tempura dish that was great .
target***I also experience the same with my MacBook Air .
source***The steak was excellent and one of the best I have had I tasted the butter intitally but in no way did it overwhelm the flavor of the meat .
source***An oasis of refinement , Food , though somewhat uneven , often reaches the pinnacles of new American fine cuisine , chef 's passion and kitchen 's precise execution is most evident in the fish dishes and soups .
source***I like the ambience , it 's very dark and original .
target***That 's how frustrating it was .
source***instead ordered an ice cold beer which to me works with indian .
target***I loved it .
target***I was n't a big fan of the Netbooks but this one was very well designed .
target***Plus stylish .
target***In the past few years , I ' ve had terrible experiences with HP .
target***-They reported that the computer is in their headquarters .
source***Ummmthe beer was cold .
source***Try the hot dogs too , they 're snappy and delicious .
target***Strengths , Well - ASPECT1 Weaknesses , A bad videocard !
source***Wine list selection is good and wine - by - the - glass was generously filled to the top .
source***The bruschetta and panini 's are so yummy !
target***The first programm I switched on was a game for my children .
source***It is a small restuarant so go early and it will be nice and quiet go late and it will be packed !
source***This place was not ALL THAT !
target***I went with him and we picked this one .
source***Two people in our party felt like something else , and Volare immediately obliged with two great dishes that were not in their regular menu .
source***Furthermore , the rice had no seasoning , so the sushi was bland and disgusting .
target***i have tried to charge on different batteries with no luck .
source***We visited Orsay during NY Restaurant Week and tried their $ 35 menu .
target***More relieved than anything .
target***This computer does n't do that well with certain games it ca n't play some and it becomes too hot while playing games .
target***Great laptop that offers many great features !
source***I ordered the smoked salmon and roe appetizer and it was off flavor .
source***Heartland Brewery is by far one of the best places in NYC to make new friends and catch up with old ones .
source***My boyfriend and I were in NY for a few days and Pastis was a place that came recommended .
target***If you had PC for four years I can almost gaurentee that something would of gone wrong by now , maybe even forcing you to replace your entire computer .
target***Gradually the freezing screen evolved into a screen that froze in weird shapes .
target***All of them were Windows machines .
target***I would say if you want to buy one of these machines be careful .
target***Being only 2 months old , I am not a happy camper !
source***I almost wanted to write a bad review , so no one would ever go here and I could have all the dumplings to myself !
source***Would recommend , perfect for those looking for a place close to grand central .
target***In my house , HP is a nasty word .
target***Shiny This Laptop is the Best of the best !
source***It 's like they took leftover chicken , poured oil and sprinkled pepper powder over it the sauce was translucent and red .
source***so i thought why not change it up a bit .
target***I ' m definitely not hard on laptops and guarantee 100 % that no liquid has touched this machine in my presence .
target***breaks easily .
source***Pizza here is consistently good .
target***I bought a HP Pavilion DV4 - 1222nr laptop and have had so many problems with the computer .
target***I paid about the same for my Toshiba as I did for the compaq a few years back .
source***The bar has various selections and the mixed drink special is a catcher ! 2 for 1 's .
target***With the macbook pro it comes with freeASPECT0 to protect it from viruses and other intrusive things from downloads and internet surfing or emails .
source***I was with a party of 7 close but not next the the front doors and we were eating with our coats on .
target***Better stick with another brand .
source***Decor is minimalist and clean , nothing to distract or commend .
target***It had some kind of pre installed software update that completely shut the computer down when you clicked it .
source***Drawbacks , service is slow and they do n't toast !
target***I got this laptop on Black Friday .
source***Try everything for that matter , it is all good .
source***I went at 6 , 00 PM specifically for the pre - theater menu $ 1995 for roasted tomato soup with chevre , steak frites , creme brulee and it was marvelous .
source***My girlfriend convinced me to go in the other night for a quick bite .
source***Even the pasta is delicious here a rarity in New York pizza restaurants .
source***the bread at the beginning is super tasty and makes you want more , the pizza is delicious and comes in personal sizes , however be warned that the Peter 's Favourite pizza with prosciutto and baby arugula is actually a margarite pizza with cold prosciutto and baby arugula on top , like a salad .
source***It was rather pathetic that it took them over an hour to seat us .
source***Your money could easily be better spent elsewhere Anywhere .
source***Alone for 100 bucks , it is really overprice .
target***I paid $ 800 for this computer from my school campus bookstore .
source***Great find ! ! !
source***With the great variety on the menu , I eat here often and never get bored .
target***They went through asking me open up various components , taking battery out , hard disk apart , and after 2 hours on phone could not fix it .
source***Been going here since it opened have seen the quality value decrease considerably .
source***Everytime I decide to try another place on the UES , I get angry that I did n't just go to Zucchero Pomodori .
target***I have used a couple of others on the job as well .
source***We were very surprised by how good the food was on our first visit here on a Sunday night .
target***It runs very quiet too which is a plus .
source***The atmosphere was crowded but it was a great bistro - type vibe .
source***Good , fast service .
source***In summer - eat outside on a terrace another great feature of Suan ! ! !
target***Getting the Apple Care plan is a must .
source***I went to Amma after a friend recommended it .
source***The plain slice is great and if you get toppings , the whole slice is topped with them , not sparsely sprinkled on like some places .
source***It 's better than being on the roof of Sutton Place with 19 year old interns jabbing you in the ribs all night .
source***I was so sad to read the bad reviews this place got !
target***This is likely due to poor grounding and isolation between the components , and I ' m hoping that it can be fixed with a ground loop isolator , but I still expected better product quality for this price range .
source***The wine list is n't great , and the desserts are shipped in from Bruno 's down the street , which is not as good as it used to be .
target***I was not aware that this product can not display websites that contain Flash .
source***It is set far from the small street it 's on , and there is no traffic noise .
target***I returned the computer to HP and they kept it for 3 months .
source***The fried rice is amazing here .
target***The battery has never worked well .
target***I bought a Logitech desktop set in anticipation for using with the MBP , but I use the touchpad 90 % of the time .
source***Overall a worthwhile experience .
source***When I arrived at Orsay I was thrown back , in a veyr good sense .
source***Even though its good seafood , the prices are too high .
source***Other than being a little crowded and a bit overpriced , the atmosphere is filled with energy and the beautiful people of course and the food was surprising good !
target***First the screen goes completely out .
target***Screen is a bit glossy , but that 's not too bad .
target***I like those programs better than Office and you can save your files to be completely compatible with the Office programs as well .
source***The service is friendly , if not the most prompt in the world , the food is great , and the prices , while not cheap , wo n't put your wallet out of commission .
target***They replaced my hard drive as well as my mother board .
source***The highlight of the night was the mayonaisse for my side of fries I received from one of the food runners , which is not good considering the bill was nearly $ 100 .
target***and it comes with the new OSX that comes with new features that makes the use more easy .
source***If you want something really different than try Jekyll and Hyde .
source***I drop more dollar bills here than your uncle after a weekend at Scores .
source***We will be back .
source***They were very abrupt with me when I called and actually claimed the food was late because they were out of rice .
source***Although the tables may be closely situated , the candle - light , food - quality and service overcompensate .
target***No tutorials on the display .
source***When he 's not making authentic Neapolitan pizza in the open brick oven or lightly frying zucchini blossoms , he 's visiting the regulars a growing legion and checking on newcomers .
target***the size of has actually help me out quite a bit by me being able to fit it in an already full backpack and to use it at a resturant where the food on the table is always so space consuming .
target***The first time it crashed was maybe going on a year and a half of having it .
target***Clear picture on it and everything .
source***Tasty steak , pork loin , the works .
target***Upgrading from Windows 7 Starter , thru Windows 7 Home Premium , to Windows 7 Professional was a snap ;
target***I remind myself from time to time to take off my watch when ever I look at the small scratch that it has caused .
source***Based on the reviews on here , it appears that the restaurant is overwhelmed after the 7 PM .
source***The tables are crammed way too close , the menu is typical of any Italian restaurant , and the wine list is simply overpriced .
source***We had the most wonderful waitress .
target***It still serves me well both in business and home needs .
target***I love it and will probably get another one when this goes to the Laptop in the sky ! !
source***From the terrible service , to the bland food , not to mention the unaccommodating managers , the overall experience was horrible .
source***Nice value .
target***The big screen allows you to enjoy watching movies , pictures and etc !
target***-No backlit keyboard , but not an issue for me .
source***Disappointing food , lousy service .
source***Traditional French decour was pleasant though the hall was rather noisy , the restaurant was full and we had to raise our voices to be able to maintain a conversation .
target***I highly recommend this computer for students looking for a solid machine to get them through college .
source***Fantastic !
target***That is how it is able to function better than any other PC .
source***Boy was I wrong !
source***The place is larger than most and features adequate seating unlike most joints , and has a bar which deserves a mention .
source***Go for it !
source***I had a terrific meal , and our server guided us toward a very nice wine in our price range , instead of allowing us to purchase a similarly priced wine that was n't as good .
source***The place itself is beautiful the bar scene seems to be happening .
target***Of course , I also have several great software packages that came for free including iWork , GarageBand , and iMovie .
source***Excellent atmosphere , delicious dishes good and friendly service .
source***I only tried a simple dish of spinach ravioli in a light oil and garlic sauce , but it actually faired better than most NYC Italian joints I ' ve tried similar dish at .
source***The photos of the restaurant in its web site are way better than the real look .
target***I use that alot on my desktop , so I am adjusting to not having it .
target***99 to fix it .
target***Everything about this computer is easy to use .
source***The outdoor atmosphere of sitting on the sidewalk watching the world go by 50 feet away on 6th avenue on a cool evening was wonderful .
source***brick oven gallery is My pick for best pizza restaurant anywhere .
target***My Mac is much more efficient than a PC so it does not need the extra bells and whistles to compete .
source***The food options rule .
target***this is starting off good .
source***You have to increase the service a lot .
source***I did n't complain , I liked the atmosphere so much .
source***Planet Thailand has always been a hit with me , I go there usually for the sushi , which is great , the thai food is excellent too .
target***My kids have to take their PCs in once a year to have them de - bugged .
source***It has been my first choice ever since I discovered it .
source***The owner and staff are all Japanese as well and that adds to the entire ambiance .
source***they bring service up a notch by offerng complementary amuse bouche to all tables and gave us a small dessert for our celebration .
source***Bon appettite ! !
source***Went inside and I started to get excited .
target***Excellent LED monitor and well equipped .
source***The wine list is extensive and impressive .
target***When we bought our new HP comouter in Dec of 2008 , we wanted Windows XP , but were told it would cost an extra $ 159 , so we went with Vista .
source***Despite the fact that the space is large , they ' ve overcrowded the floor with tables .
target***They say that this will invalidate the warranty on the hard drive I do n't really understand why but anyway .
source***Had 1 appetizer , 2 entrees and 2 cokes and the bill was ~ $ 5500 , not including tip .
source***The place is small and intimate and you may feel a little crowded , but the service is excellent and it 's great for friends out , a romantic date , or a special occassion .
source***despite the untasteful previous review .
source***The atmosphere is unheralded , the service impecible , and the food magnifica n't .
target***AND the best part is that it even comes with a free printer when they have a certain promotion / offer going , of course !
target***But when I received my replacement , I made BOTH recovery DVDs 4 , and a driver / application DVD .
target***So , owing to these problems , I went out and got myself an Apple MacBook Pro , which I am using with great satisfaction at this very moment .
source***Also , because it is so thin , it gets cold very quickly and its not that filling .
target***Buyers beware .
target***That whole experience was just ridiculous we sent it in and after they told us that we had to pay $ 175 to fix it we were like we will just by a portable mouse which would be way cheaper but they refused to send the laptop back until we paid the $ 175 and it was fixed .
target***There is NO way I will buy a LG product in the future .
target***I already have a HP laptop I bought last year that 's standard size .
target***Within 3 weeks the same issues started happening AGAIN .
source***The brioche and lollies as party favors is a cute and sweet touch to a most memorable meal .
target***The ease of use is wonderful .
target***The only thing I would change about it is the mouse keys .
source***The barebecued salmon is elegantly spiced and not at all dry .
target***All in all great item highly recommend it .
target***Which is great I am running Vista Business and scored a 5X on the index I have never seen a windows machine have a total score in the 5 's .
target***The Nortons virus scan is only for a very short time unlike others that usually are good for a year .
source***A wonderful place !
source***we were seated at the sushi bar in front of yasuda .
source***Great people watching as others do the same to you .
target***I can guarantee this will be the last Dell I will ever purchase !
target***It was a laugh too !
source***We come from New Jersey to eat at Kinoko .
target***It seems they could have updated XP and done without creating Vista .
target***Another issue I have with it is the battery .
source***I am relatively new to the area and tried Pick a bgel on 2nd and was disappointed with the service and I thought the food was overated and on the pricey side .
source***The pesto pizza was excellent , thin - crust pizza with a nice amount of spicy Italian cheese that I 'd never heard of before .
source***Oh yes , and they lie on the phone , claiming they have seating in the garden , then of course the seats are not available .
target***I think I might rather suffer for something that is simple to fix in my opinion .
source***I absolutely Loved this place .
source***The workers there also absolutely load the bagel with cream cheese gets a little messy .
source***When family came in he gave them apps to test their palets , and then ordered for them .
target***so the fact that the computer does not work on the 24 twenty fourth day is my fault .
target***One of them seems to have worked .
source***always fresh and delicious .
source***It is far more popular as a bar than as a restaurant , with only a few tables and the waiter being the bar , but we greatly enjoyed the unobtrusive atmosphere .
source***If you like your music blasted and the system is nt that great and if you want to pay at least 100 dollar bottle minimun then you 'll love it here .
target***The Material this Pro is made out of seems a lot nicer than any PC Specs , Like I said this performs a lot better than any computer I ' ve had in the past .
target***The first one sent , Touchpad did n't work The second sent , USB did n't work The third sent , Touchpad did n't work The fourth sent , Has n't arrived yet .
target***I love a pc but I was ready for a change and tired of the windows system .
source***Great bagels made the old - fashioned way .
source***The waiter was attentive .
target***it is an amazing image and it too is holding up quite nicely to little hands grabbing the back of my laptop .
target***I have had my new Macbook Pro i5 for a couple of days and have recycled ALL of my old PC laptops .
source***The two star chefs left quite some time ago to open their own place .
target***The resolution on the screen is almost pure HD .
target***The only thing I can imagine is that Sony jumped on early specifications for Vista requirements from Microsoft and designed it to those inadequate requirements .
source***I loved it and will be back soon .
target***Now they are believers in the product .
source***Our son loves pizza and we have a certified Neapolitan pizza in our home city Seattle , we liked this nearly as much , and the differences were more about personal preference than any reflection on either restaurant .
source***The waitress suggested glasses of wine that went very well with the food .
target***I would like to use a different operating system altogether .
source***Service is top notch .
source***it is not consistent .
target***This laptop serves all my needs .
source***Nice Family owned traditional restaurant .
target***And in 6 months , there have been no freezing up and no blue , purple , black or any other type of screen .
source***I understand the area and folks you need not come here for the romantic , alluring ambiance or the five star service featuring a sommlier and a complicated maze of captain and back waiters , you come for the authentic foods , the tastes , the experiance .
source***Tuk Tuk is one of those comfortable neighborhood joints where you know you will always have a good meal at a fair price .
target***Size , I know 13 is small especially for a desktop replacement but with an external monitor , who cares .
source***I ' ve eaten thai many times , and am very familiar with the cuisine .
source***We left , never to return .
source***PERFECT FOR DATES !
target***since then i have had minor problems with slow operation .
source***The bagels are fabulous .
source***The portion sizes here are huge , and the sushi is good .
target***the mcbook pro notebook will make it easy for you to write and read your emails at blazing speeds .
source***Could be pricey without a prix fixe meal .
source***Admittedly some nights inside the restaurant were rather warm , but the open kitchen is part of the charm .
source***The soup is pretty good too .
source***i asked for them spicy and they were delicious .
source***Monday nights are a bargain at the $ 28 prix fix , this includes a three course meal plus * three * glasses of wine paired with each course .
target***Runs Hot I thought we were paying for quality in our decision to buy an Apple product .
source***The staff offers impeccable service .
target***They ended up keeping my computer for almost 3 months !
source***Their wines by the glass are a great accompaniment and you can eat like a king with wine for under $ 30 .
target***I am also upset with CR for giving a good rating .
target***It did n't come with any software installed outside of windows media , but for the price , I was very pleased with the condition and the overall product .
source***you can actually get 2 salads worth if u take it home and add it to some lettuce !
source***But when you are seated the waitresses are great , they explain everything on the menu , and the price of the food is really cheap for the service you get .
source***After hearing a lot of great things about the restaurant , and passing by it on a daily basis , we decided to try .
target***Gave phonenumber .
target***This netbook is a perfect supplementary computer to another laptop or desktop my wife and I have another laptop , or if you are a user who uses the computer for simple tasks .
source***Really .
source***This was my frist time at Cafe St Bart 's and I must say how delicous the food and the service was .
target***If you have any creativity in you do yourself a favor and get a mac !
source***The quantity is also very good , you will come out satisfied .
target***Was disappointed to find out that the model had been discontinued , apparently because of known motherboard problems .
source***The pizza is good though .
target***I bought for my son in the 2nd grade .
source***Definitely Highly NOT recommended .
target***I took it to the shop and they said It would cost too much to repair it .
target***It will be returned in the state to which it was shipped Michigan .
source***From the entrees to the sides to the drinks , everything was creatively prepared yet still simple .
source***I ' ve been to Naples 45 for dinner twice .
target***You know what ? I happened to buy a defective blood pressure monitor a week ago at the Bukit Batok Polyclinic NHG Pharmacy a week ago .
target***A mac is very easy to use and it simply makes sense .
source***This place is great .
source***Anyways , if you 're in the neighborhood to eat good food , I would n't waste my time trying to find something , rather go across the street to Tamari .
source***I have known about this secret for the last 13 years , Emiliothe Godfather has continued to serve food and wine for the gods at mortal prices .
target***You 'll need to upgrade and pay a little more for them .
source***First off , the waitress was completely unattentive the 2 times we saw herodd in a restaurant with 6 tables and got our order wrong .
target***You just get a trial version either way .
target***I love it , never had a computer I was so impressed with , and I ' ve had a lot of laptops and desktops , this one is FAR AND ABOVE THE BEST ONE I EVER HAD BEFORE .
target***They are about the same size keys .
source***Cheese plate is a varied delight and great bargain at $ 10 .
target***Was very much worth the price i paid .
source***The banana tower is an amazing dessert as well .
target***But Sony said we could send it back and be charged for adding the bluetooth an additional seventy something dollars .
source***The staff there is very attentive and down to earth .
source***Consequently , their burgers fell apart in their hands and made such a mess that they did'nt feel like finishing them .
source***For the next hour and a half we stood in the crowded lobby area of this touristy restaurant listening to all types of explanations of why we were not being seated .
source***My boyfriend and I have been to The Minnow four times now and we have consistently been impressed .
target***First things first , Macbook pro has many applications to make life easier , unlike the windows computers .
target***I bought it for my mom and she reports that the battery life lasts all day for her , it 's very lightweight , and the response for the computing she 's doing Internet focused activity , mail , research , etc is excellent ; .
source***Yeah Shanghai is also great but not quite as good - they use the same amount of salt but without sweetness to balance out .
source***The corned beef and pastrami are excellent , much less fatty than those big tourist places around Times Square .
target***I use the computer to basically check emails , surf the web , print coupons and for my college papers .
source***I ' m saving up for my next visit .
source***all the food was excellent , considering the quality of food in most moderately priced restaurants is mediocre this was slightly more pricey and well worth it .
target***They were great in handling this problem , and I ' m looking forward in purchasing additonal products from them in the future .
target***The machine is slow to boot up and occasionally crashes completely .
source***The service was a bit slow , but they were very friendly .
target***The paint wears off easily due to the keyboard being farther back than usual .
target***Apparently under the screen there are 2 little screws and when the screen gets moved back and forth , they come loose .
target***C'm on , LG .
source***Anyway , the food is good , the price is right and they have a decent wine list .
source***They sell special sushi , everything have a topping , sauce and etc .
source***Horrible .
target***My friend reports the notebook is astonishing in performance , picture quality , and ease of use .
source***A++ The service was good to excellent along with the attitude .
target***Very satisfied .
target***It 's a long and tirring process that after a while it seems like their game plan was to wear you out so you would want to give up on contacting them .
target***They have more problems then a 1980 's computer .
target***My sister is the electronics manager at Wal Mart and she says that HP is the best .
target***Oh , boy !
target***Windows XP SP2 caused many problems on the computer , so I had to remove it .
target***I had this computer for one month and had to send it in for repair .
source***It 's called Gnochi alla nona and is found under Chef Specials .
source***I 'll be back soon .
target***The hard drive crashed as well , and I had to buy a new power cord .
source***My boyfriend ate tuna and it was cooked perfectly !
source***Overall I would recommend it and go back again .
target***I'v spent as much for shipping as I would to buy a new netbook - of course a different brand .
source***Dessert , ca n't be missed , so save room ! ! !
source***Some of the workers ignore me and talk to the female customers , other times , they ' ve skipped my order .
target***I ' m tired of the inept service .
source***Tasty but expensive .
source***The service was superb , they treat you like family .
target***apple is one of the best computer companies in the country .
source***The food is great and reasonably priced .
source***I recently tried Suan and I thought that it was great .
source***Service was quick .
source***THR AT MOSHPHERE IS COMPACT , MODERN , YET COZY .
target***All the problems I have had with PC 's are solved with a Mac , the issue of overheating - my Dell was always overheating and not working properly or simply shutting off , and the issue of viruses and contaminants - my HP completely quit working within2 years of purchasing it , with no inexpensive way of fixing it .
source***wo nt come back again for sure !
target***There is nothing better .
target***I ' m glad I bought this laptop , it was worth the few $ 100 extra dollars .
target***The operating system and user interface is very intuitive , and the large multi - touch track pad is amazing .
source***Now at the top of our list , Del Frisco 's Steakhouse .
target***The love part of my relationship with this laptop does n't take very long .
source***All of the pizzas are terrific and the price is even better !
target***Again I sent it back and they replaced the motherboard and some fan inside .
target***I just got this laptop for college , and so far I am very happy with it .
source***THe Pizza and wine were excellent - the service too -- but what really MADE this place was the backyard dining area .
source***On a recent Sunday afternoon , a friend and I accidently found this great restaurant on our way to see the pulitzer prize winning play DOUBT .
target***I have owned macbook pros since 2005 and this is the best yet !
source***The food was actually aweful .
source***The food can get price but the prixe fixe tasting menu is the greatest food for a good price and they cater the food to any food allergies or food you do n't like .
source***The service was typical short - order , dinner type .
target***I baby my electronics so I know for a fact it was defective and not anything that I did to it .
target***The screen is bright and vivid and the keyboard is very easy to use , very important for use quick typers .
target***Unfortunately , the laptop I purchased was also a Dell and again , I have to say i hated it .
target***this laptop is durable and it is easy to travel with .
source***Baluchi 's has solid food and a nice decor at reasonable prices .
target***With a MAC computer I have more free time as I do n't have to wait for windows to boot up or shut down and all the viruses associated with windows .
source***Take a good sense of humor , an American express card with no limit , walk out with a lollipop , gift bag in hand and enough marketing materials for alain to to take the show on the road
source***It 's also attached to Angel 's Share , which is a cool , more romantic bar .
source***my first time here was with my gf for our 12 month anniversary .
target***I will never go back to Windows !
target***This is perfect for her field .
source***Our waiter was fine , the place looks nice in that not - trying - too - hard way , but at those prices , a little more should be expected of your food .
source***Each table has a pot of boiling water sunken into its surface , and you get platters of thin sliced meats , various vegeASPECT0s , and rice and glass noodles .
source***The menu is limited but almost all of the dishes are excellent .
target***The tech store I purchased this from sent it back , , , , , eventually I got a new or repaired machine approximately 3 weeks later .
target***Like the price and operation .
target***They are closed at 9 pm eastern .
target***It did not have all the features I expected it to have .
target***I am however pleased that it is still hanging in there .
source***Our first greeting when we entered was The last call is at 10 , 15 .
source***Someone else recommended the dessert , we also left that .
source***It was nice and fresh , but I ca n't give it high scores on being authentic thai .
source***We were pleasantly greeted .
target***Not to mention , the battery life is absolutely amazing .
source***So my husband made up an excuse so we can leave .
source***By the time we were done , it was past 1 , 00am .
target***I am loyal to Apple .
source***Try the Times Square cocktail - ginger lemonade with vodka also available without vodka .
source***Odd for Ave B , not just odd , The place attracts an eclectic crowd to say the least .
source***Over price , and small portions .
source***I had to share my table with a loud group of kids and the service was rude an unattentive .
source***For many people , this may not seem like Aunthentic Thai food because most places in NYC are nt quite authentic .
source***Frankly , when you compare what you can have here for lunch , versus McDs or so many other sandwich shops in the city , there is no comparison .
source***The food is prepared quickly and efficiently .
source***I for one will never patronize them again .
target***Features such as the Dashboard allows you to view frequently used tools like a calculator , weather forecast , movie times , calendar , computer post its etc .
target***Not working bad
target***lightweight , long battery life , excellent transition from PC ;
target***Good for every day computing and web browsing .
source***Warning , You may find it difficult to dine at other Japanese restaurants after a visit to Mizu !
target***I dislike the quality and the placement of the speakers .
target***The Macbook arrived in a nice twin packing and sealed in the box , all the functions works great .
target***The Notebook PC , Toshiba Qosmio is the best gift my father could have ever gotten me .
target***however , I may have inadvertently thrown out one of the batteries with the shipping carton .
source***With so many good restaurants on the UWS , I do n't need overpriced food , absurdly arrogant wait - staff who do n't recognize they work at a glorified diner , clumsy service , and management that does n't care .
target***The touchpad is very intuitive , so much so that I never want to use buttons to click again !
source***My entire family was horrified .
source***The food is fresh , delicious , and reasonably priced .
source***for Meetball Night .
source***After 2 tries by the waiter to take it away we had n't even looked at it yet , we had full beers yet to drink , the manager approached and told us they needed the table for people with reservations .
target***I would recomend this acer to parents and grandparents it can really help them in school .
target***Everything was up and running within 15 minutes of unboxing .
source***Another plus is most of the entrees are approx .
target***also it comes with very useful applications like iphoto that it is the best photo application i have ever had
target***I have found it very easy to use , very imformative , wonder alerts and tutorials making it very easy for someone like me who is not exactly technologically advanced to learn to use the various features and programs .
target***without having to have extra equipment and/or complicated routes to take to be able to do so .
target***I reloaded with Windows 7 Ultimate , and the Bluetooth and Fingerprint reader software would not load .
source***Worse of all , $ 60 was erroneously added to our $ 80 bill .
source***I loved it and would go again .
target***Very disappointed !
target***I decided I wanted a laptop so I went into the BBY store .
target***I ca n't even turn it off .
target***just chill and enjoy .
source***Having discovered Ping 's on the internet , we entered with qualms but were instantly put to ease by the fish tanks that greet you as u walk in .
target***Another thing is that after only a month the left mouse key broke and it costed $ 175 to send it in to fix it .
target***In addition , all the design tools on Pages and Keynotes makes it much easier to create professional looking documents and presentations .
source***Anybody who likes this place must be from a different planet , where greasy , dry and tasteless are complimentary .
source***The staff is excellent , specjal , that girl behind the bar , european chic .
target***The notebook would not turn back on again .
source***After the review I treked into Brooklyn .
target***It is very durable , I am pretty rough when it comes to electronics and it has taken it all with no reprecutions yet .
target***It has plenty of memory , lots of hard drive , and great graphics .
source***if your into thaiyou can not miss this great restaurant .
target***Of course , I inspected the other netbooks and clearly their hinges are tighter and I even demonstrate the difference between my netbook and others .
source***The prices were CHEAP compared to the quality of service and food .
source***Great food and the prices are very reasonable .
target***The only time I have restarted is during system updates .
target***For me I was lucky and a local store was selling them for $ 2000 off and Best Buy matched their price so I was able to buy one for under $ 1000
source***We were walking around the village and went into this place just for some drinks .
source***The sushi was awful !
source***It was the first place we ate on our first trip to New York , and it will be the last place we stop as we head out of town on our next trip to New York .
source***All in all , I do n't see how you can go wrong .
source***We were disappointed with the pre - fixe menu of only 2 choices per course other restaurants offer 3 choices and ended up ordering a la carte .
target***They are asking me to ship the unit back to fix it at their site .
target***I sent it back and found this time that the battery was faulty , so I got a new one and some other fixes they found .
target***It 's fast , it 's easy easy easy to set up , easy to hook to my wireless network .
source***The grilled cheese at home afterwards was better ! ! .
target***I will never buy another computer from Dell ever again do to how awful it worked and how I was treated by the company .
target***Finally , I should note that I took the 2 GB RAM stick from my old EeePC and installed it before I even powered on for the first time .
target***But , for the cost this is a winner .
source***We were well attended to by the enthusiastic staff especially the manager Tony Gaskin who made excellent suggestions for our menu selections .
source***Overall the restaurant is more expensive than our other sushi favorites , but everything was delicious .
target***It out performs any other laptop on the market today .
source***As always we had a great glass of wine while we waited .
target***No laptop is perfect , but sometimes you just find a computer that works for you .
target***also the battery is completely shot .
source***I recently went to this restaurant with some co - workers for lunch and had an amazing time .
target***I really do n't like it , but I am stuck .
source***And the food was fantastic .
target***It bluescreened on me without any warning , running simply basic Chrome .
source***The signs , the specials menus , food , and even all the waitstaff are ALL TOTALLY Japanese .
target***It even has a great webcam , and Skype works very well .
target***A great feature is the spotlight search , one can search for documents by simply typing a keyword , rather than parsing tens of file folders for a document .
source***What a great place .
source***Lahore is a great place to duck into late - night when you need some really tasty food on the cheap - you 'll likely have trouble finishing the amount of food you get for FOUR DOLLARS .
target***There is a blank lighted screen when I start and that is all .
target***The only thing that I have , is the key broad is a little dark to see the letters , would help if it was a little lighter then it is .
target***also the keyboard does not liht up so unless your sitting in a room with some light you ca n't see anything and that s bad for me because my boyfriend tends to watch tv in the dark at night which leaves me with no way of seeing the keyboard .
target***2 months later , the battery went .
target***Simple to use , and great graphics .
target***I recommend the Macbook Pro if you want the best laptop on the market .
source***A restaurant that does n't try to do anything except serve great food with great service in a pleasant atmosphere .
source***The seafood is amazing , there 's a good wine list , and the ever - changing menu always offers some great surprises .
source***A big disappointment , all around .
source***Do n't leave without trying One Night in Tokyo .
target***I got tired of buying laptops and having them stop working after a year .
source***The pizza was pretty good and huge .
source***The website and rating makes this place look wonderful but in reality it was very disappointing .
source***Chinese Desserts are known for healthful benefits in addition to the sweetness .
target***It was an all around waste of money for me .
target***It 's fun to take to a bookstore , sit in the coffee shop area , sign in to WiFi and look up book reviews of books I might buy .
target***A SECOND PROBLEM INVOLVES THE BATTERY WHICH IS ADVERTISED AS HAVING A STORAGE LIFE OF 11 HOURS BUT WHEN FULLY CHARGED SHOWS ONLY 7 HOURS OF SERVICE .
source***We saw them heating up at least one frozen item though I ' m not sure which dim sum dish it was .
source***The place is small and cramped but the food is fantastic .
source***This is as good as neighborhood restaurants come .
source***though the service could be better possibly due to more than one very large group in the house , it is very cordial and warm , as is the general clientele .
target***It 's so useable and responsive .
target***This is the third MacBook Pro in our family .
source***In fact , two people could really share one plate .
target***The only thing I wish is the 15 inch MacBook Pro has much better speakers on the side of the keyboard .
target***They say it could be the motherboard again , but Dell
source***The price is reasonable although the service is poor .
source***Stepped on my foot on the SECOND time he reached over me to adjust lighting .
target***Yes , a Mac is much more money than the average laptop out there , but there is no comparison in style , speed and just cool factor .
source***The ambiance is minimal the food is not phenomenal , but some dishes are quite good , such as the eggplant parmesan , veal in carozza chicken saltimbocca .
target***I have in the past gotten superfine sandpaper and fixed the edges by rounding them off .
target***System is loosing about 20 % of performance because of that .
source***And the staff is also young , energeic and hot ! ! ! !
source***Highly recommended to all !
source***A hearty two thumbs up !
source***I went to Ruby Foo 's after work with a group of 6 .
target***And Toshiba is a quality supplier .
target***Does a great job with video shot on a Canon 5D MKII .
target***Hmmm , that high failure rate sure is n't reflected in the retail price .
source***Skip this location and go to the one in Soho .
target***I love my macbook pro !
target***The applications are also very easy to find and maneuver , much easier than any other computer I have ever owned .
target***The iLife software that comes with the computer is so simple to use and produces a great finished product .
target***it is hard to fix and makes it a hassle to own one .
source***The food was delicious I had a halibut special , my husband had steak , and the service was top - notch .
target***When I took it back to Best Buy I asked them if they were seriously trying to drive me insane !
source***I ve been here so many times the waiters know my name .
target***In the three years I ' ve had my MacBook Pro , I have never had a virus on my computer , and I do a lot of work on the internet .
target***Thank God for ctrl ZBottom line , I ' ve been using laptops since the mid 90s and probably the majority of brands out there .
source***If you go for the pre - theatre menu , it 's an even greater deal .
source***This time , I prefer not to go into detail .
target***I like it so much , I bought another just for my wife .
source***I ' m partial to the Gnocchi .
source***What I did n't like was how the food came right after it was ordered .
target***I did a review on it , its awesome .
target***My favorite by far , although the most expensive , was my Sony .
source***I only have friends .
source***The rest of the dim sum , though pricey by Chinatown standards , is worth it .
source***Get there before 7 pm .
source***I recommend this spot to anyone who enjoys fine cuisine at reasonable prices .
target***Long story , but after many calls to various offices , I was told that no one can override the depot and that managers do n't take phone calls or e / mails .
target***-Stay away from Apple , or hope you laptop does not break down .
source***Have always found that the waiters will go out of their way to be helpful , despite the fact they are often busy with lots of diners .
target***I would buy this lap top over and over again !
target***Sony parts reliability and quality of service is recenlty the worst .
source***Probably much busier for lunch , it 's seldom crowded for dinner too close to downtown .
target***Great product , very easy to use and great graphics .
target***By Air sounds more like by truck to Me .
source***I highly recommend Caviar Russe to anyone who wants delicious top grade caviar and fantastic service .
target***We have had numerous problems with Vista , such as Adobe Flash player just quits and has to be uninstalled and then reinsalled , Internet Explore just quits and you lose whatever you were working on , also , the same Windows update has appeared on this computer since we got it and has been update probably 400 times , the same update .
source***If presentation and service is your thing , then this magic show works .
target***Will probably never buy a HP again .
source***My friends and I came across this place while walking in the village .
target***What can I say .
source***The only weird thing was if we got a bottle , the waitress would have simply multiplied the glass price X4 , which makes no sense whatsoever .
target***the speed is fine .
source***I went there with my friend last saturday .
target***It is easy to operate and I have already ordered more software and gadgets for my new Rolls Royce of laptops .
target***I am enjoying it and the quality it provides is great !
source***The service is ok but could be better .
source***Was there Friday night .
target***As an owner of a Toshiba Satalite laptop computer things you should know before you buy .
target***-Estimated time to fix it , 10 working days or less .
source***The service is ok , some of the people did n't get what they asked for .
source***This restaurant is not worth the time , effort , or money to say the least .
source***I would highly recommend this place to anyone who is looking for a fine Indian dining experience that is definitely a value for your dollar .
source***The catch is that you are charged extra for ANYTHING that you leave on your plate so do n't be a greedy pig !
target***I am a full Mac convert now .
source***We ' ve been following chef Lyle 's food around New York for 15 years and while remaining classic , his innovations with bistro fare have made us return and return .
source***we did notice however , that some tables had what looked like pita instead of naan .
target***Sure it has the one touch keys but that was the best feature of the computer .
target***So then you may be lucky to get ahold to someone who understands that its no good and they will let you send it back , but of course you are taking a chance of them testing it out to see what has happened , and they tell you that it was not on their side , then you are stuck paying for the repair the price of a new one .
source***Perhaps this food is considered extreme to an Upper East Side resident , but for the rest of us who ' ve actually eaten ethnic food , this is simply dull .
target***NO good .
target***I will never buy anything from HP again !
target***i spent eight hundred dollars from a giant paper weight that looks good on a bus .
source***You will find yourself returning quite often .
source***Chennai Garden is my favorite Indian restaurant in the city .
target***Speakers too small to be of any real use .
source***I fell in love with the egg noodles in the beef broth with shrimp dumplings and slices of BBQ roast pork .
source***We ordered the chicken casserole , but what we got were a few small pieces of chicken , all dark meat and on the bone .
source***but still my date was bad
source***However , it 's not worth a special trip .
target***Registration/1st use is easy .
target***I Have a friend who has the other model and we put them side by side with the same dvd in battle of the Smithsonian After on Hour mine was at 53 % life left and his was at 69 % life left .
source***I was pleasantly suprised .
source***SEA has become so popular that they ' ve let it go to their heads .
target***The screen shows great colors .
source***We took advanatage of the half price sushi deal on saturday so it was well worth it .
source***The food is good , especially their more basic dishes , and the drinks are delicious .
target***It fires up in the morning in less than 30 seconds and I have never had any issues with it freezing .
source***The food there is so good that even to order out the wait is incredible .
target***I hate it .
target***I highly recommend this laptop to anybody that wants great performance from a laptop and would like to relax and not become enraged cursing the gods about to throw your laptop out the door .
source***Brava La Pizza Fresca !
source***I ' ve lived in NY for 5 years and this place has it all .
target***Would buy 100 more of these if I could .
source***Go , go , hurry , before everyone finds out about it .
target***in 5 months the connect quality got worse and worse .
source***So close , but not good enough .
target***So if anyones looking to buy a computer or laptop you should stay far far away from any that have the name TOSHIBA on it .
source***Sure , the setting is nice .
target***I had 3 months when the ports started going out .
target***Although I was promised about 10 hours , I found myself to a limited 7 hours which is still amazing .
source***When we left at 8 , 00 PM , it was packed and noisy .
source***Once you step into Cosette , you 're miraculously in a small , off - the - beaten path Parisian bistro .
target***my niece and nephew have played a few web games and it runs anything that does n't require a dedicated video card .
target***Aside from the trial software and the short battery life , lack of a webcam , its great .
source***I ' ve been there three times and have always had wonderful experiences .
target***The second issue I had with it occured a month later and it kept overheating , even if on for less than an hour !
source***Please be aware that it 's CASH or AMEX only !
target***I wish the volume could be louder and the mouse did n't break after only a month .
target***Images are crisp and clean .
source***service was efficient courteous .
target***Dismantle the whole thing ? Then it will not be a newly manufactured set like before .
target***If you already own a 2009 , 2010 , or early 2011 model , you should wait until the next update .
source***Suan is a great place that I often take my friends classmates too .
source***Not a small feat for good french food in the area .
source***Everything that happened was not even up to mediocre .
target***It has no camera but , I can always buy and install one easy .
source***I ' m not picky , but it was actually gross .
source***Stick to dimsum , not super overpriced noodles .
source***A cheap eat for NYC , but not for dosa .
target***On two occasions the computer s calendar told me it was 1969 .
target***I'ts nice to have the higher - end laptops , but this fits my budget and the features I need .
source***We did n't get drink refills and she did n't even offer us the option of dessert .
target***I was looking too closely at the other performance specs and while comparing , I took it for granted that these features were standard .
target***I ' m going to try and keep my old G4 on the road for as long as possible .
target***I will definitely be getting a new laptop if it has any more issues after the warranty expires and researching carefully when I do so I do n't run accross a situation like this again !
target***I LOVE it !
target***I have used both PCs and Macs and I have to say that I really really love my Mac Book Pro .
source***The staff was the friendliest that have seen in New York .
target***I do transcription work on the side , and the flatline keyboard makes typing quick and easy as well .
target***I have never had an experience like this .
target***Mac computers automatically defrag each time you start your computer .
source***I ' ve been several times and am totally smitten .
source***The place was real empty but that was because this was the first Sunday they ever opened .
source***The food is delicious and beautifully prepared along with the friendly and personable service .
target***It has a faster processor and more ram .
source***The staff is courteous and friendly .
source***The food is reliable and the price is moderate .
source***Great wine list , reasonably priced -- Sara .
target***Even doing so , the hinge may just be slightly tightened only .
target***Boots up fast and runs great !
target***The keyboard is too slick .
target***Everything was so easy .
target***I bought my first MacBook after seeing the product demonstrated .
target***Asked the customer service rep .
target***They informed me that I had around 7 policies or viruses on it .
target***I especially like the keyboard which has chiclet type keys .
target***Apparently well - ASPECT2 and gorgeous to look at , the i5 MacBook Pro is a winning combination of price and performance .
target***I would recommend this laptop to anyone looking to get a new laptop who is willing to spend a little more money to get great quality !
source***Given the incredible architecture surrounding it , this place has no character .
target***I Hate it !
target***I was a little weary at purchasing another 13 macbook almost 2 years later but t looks like the newer macbooks have gotten its current line of graphics cards in order this time around .
source***Volare virgins or weekly regulars , everyone gets treated the same and you ca n't ask for more than that when the service is this friendly .
target***This is the complete opposite to an ergonomic design .
target***The battery life seems to be very good , and have had no issues with it .
target***MacBook Notebooks quickly die out because of their short battery life , as well as the many background programs that run without the user 's knowlede .
source***We will go back every time we are in the City .
target***I did n't like one thing about it .
source***But the thing that my wife and I hated was it was so loud and it felt like bar or pub ' .
target***If your time is worth anything to you , if you are tired of rebooting , reformatting , reinstalling , trying to find drivers , if you want a computer to work for you for a change , make the change to this computer .
source***The establishment scores big points in presentation and style .
source***I like Mamoun 's food as well , but side by side , Kati Rolls just produce tastier food hands down .
source***head and shoulders above its neighboors on east 6 st , taj mahal is also very comparable , in food quality , to the much overpraised and underdeserving baluchi 's .
source***If we were to move from the upper east side , we would genuinely miss this restaurant .
target***It is very user friendly and not hard to figure out at all .
target***I did think it had a camera because that was one of my requirements , but forgot to check in the specifications on this one before I purchased .
source***Behind this counter , two men are squeezed in .
target***The board has a bad connector with the power supply and shortly after warrenty expires the power supply will start having issues .
target***this is one of the reasons I purchased it .
target***overall i would recomend this to anybody and tell them that if they want to burn their music or play there video games to buy the cd drive .
source***Murray wo n't do it .
target***He came into my house , fiddled around on the computer for a good forty minutes and got ready to leave before it was even done doing what he was doing to it .
source***The entire place and the treatment we received felt as a conveyor belt .
target***I ' M REALLY FRUSTRATED BY THIS EXPERIENCE .
target***It was a hard decision for me since the MacBook Pro looked so appealing .
target***The best thing to do is build your own computer , but if u ca n't company 's like dell who allow you to choose the components are better and for the same price you can get a computer who compares to one of apple $ 2000 systems and if you google dell coupons you can find codes that take a signifant amount off the price .
source***The place is so cool and the service is prompt and curtious .
source***The staff has always been friendly without seeming grating , and the chef has greeted us on a couple of occasions .
target***The laptop is relatively simple to use , though I bought Macs for Dummies , which is well worth $ 2
source***I loved this place ! !
target***As a die - hard Windows enthusiast , I shunned the idea of a Mac until this point .
source***We try frequenting new restaurants all over the city , but any time that we visit a restaurant other than Roth 's we are always disappointed .
target***Connecting to my wireless router via built - in wireless took no time at all .
target***he ca n't stand it .
target***3DMARK6 score is only 8500 .
source***Faan is sooo good .
target***It 's so nice to look at and the keys are easy to type with .
target***But I was wrong .
source***You will be satisfied .
target***I got it back again and was told the motherboard had been replaced , so I was now on the SECOND motherboard within 3 months .
target***I ordered through MacMall , which saved me the sales tax I would have incurred buying locally .
target***I still have that stupid bluetooth mouse to !
source***This place is always packed .
source***The pizza is delicious and the proprietor is one of the nicest in NYC .
source***Good to find a restaurant where the owners have some imagination and they have actually pulled it off , like in this case .
target***My kids and dogs destroyed two power cords by pulling on them .
target***Maybe three or four months ago it started blinking all of the sudden .
source***The food inludes famous scrumptious bombay style chaat such as bhelpuri , sevpuri and samosa chaats , as well as other great indian appetizers .
source***What for ?
source***not the food , not the ambiance , not the service , I agree with the previous reviews you wait and wait , the wait staff are very rude and when you get in they are looking to get you right out .
target***I ' m excited to learn more about what this powerful machine has to offer and encourage others to do the same .
target***I had been a Windows user before this I love the size because the screen is big enough for what I use it for Internet , artwork , and yet it is small enough to be reasonably portable .
target***it has 3 usb ports , 1 sd memory card reader and an sd memory car expansion .
target***The battery life sucked the juice from my laptop and when the extended life battery went out we were SOL there to , so much for that warranty covering all the products we purchased .
source***One of my favorite places in Manhattan .
source***Price and quality of fish alone will keep us from making a return visit .
target***Despite the plethora of problems , I managed to use technological trickery to keep the machine operational for two years .
source***Off the beaten path , this jewel of a restaurant shines just one block away from the plethora of 6th street Indian restaurants .
source***I do n't know about you guys , but when I go somewhere to eat I go for the food not for the atmosphere .
target***But to be honest , the compatibility issues and the other little quirks make me think I ll buy a PC next time .
target***I was sorly disapointed to discover that HP what I thought was a reputable company would n't honor the warrenty when the fan blade fell apart .
target***So , I went back .
source***Always a nice crowd , but never loud .
target***My laptop now has no battery .
target***So , you can imagine how unhappy I am with this item .
target***I ca n't say enough of how satisfied I am with their product and help aftermarket .
target***The keyboard is like no other laptop keyboard .
source***It is a lot of fun with live entertainment and all kinds of Disney type special effects .
source***One of the earlier people commenting on the restaurant did not get the that some experimenting is going on with the menu in a positive way .
source***I just wonder how you can have such a delicious meal for such little money .
target***I am a college student and it has been very useful .
source***This quiet dark asian bistro is well worth the trip .
target***Consumer Report recommended Toshiba .
source***The food is great and authentic .
target***Granted , it 's still a very new laptop but in comparison to my previous laptops and desktops , my Mac boots up noticeably quicker .
target***I had always used PCs and been constantly frustrated by the crashing and the poorly designed operating systems that were never very intuitive .
source***However , it just so happens that there 's an even more amazing place just down the street .
source***The decor is really blah , and not at all hip or happening .
source***This was one of the BEST restaurants I ' ve ever been to .
target***I bought a protector for my key pad and it works great ,
target***First , you ll discover that the word processing program known as Appleworks rarely translates perfectly on anyone else s computer , if it translates at all .
target***Keyboard is reasonable size .
source***The menu prices are a bit expensive for what you get in quality and portion size .
source***While we thoroughly enjoyed the food , it was annoying to scream across the table for conversation .
target***Now 17 months later they want would not say exact amount $ 16500 to $ 400 to fix the machine .
target***The most recent being that my Safari internet browser is freaking out on me , but I have just been using firefox instead .
source***The food and staff always surprise me with the new heights they are taken to .
source***The setting is casual and romantic .
source***This place is greatly welcome in the desolate little strip between the Prospect Expressway and Greenwood Cemetery , a wasteland we like to call The Sliv .
source***The mussaman curry that I ordered was as thin as water and aside from the poorly fried tofu that I ordered in it , they graciously provided me with ONE piece of poorly cooked potato .
source***Even with a relatively inexpensive botle of wine , if you can call $ 7000 inexpensive , the cost is through the roof for better than average fare .
target***It took me a while top get away from the land of PCs , but now that I have , I ca n't see myself going back to it .
source***Its a great place for a casual date or to entertain clients for lunch .
source***The restaraurant is very small so reservations are a must .
target***It does nt work worth a damn .
target***I would not recommend this product to anyone .
target***About 1/2 of the sites I need to visit because of my work contain some type of Flash .
target***This computer literally takes about five minutes to start up and to be able to use without it crawling and I DO mean crawling .
source***I had the duck breast special on my last visit and it was incredible .
target***It is the worst laptop ever
target***When I am at Starbucks between clients I get full bars on my HP and 1 bar on my Eee PC .
source***If you like Sakagura but you feel it 's too much , you 'd better try Yokocho .
source***However , in the summer of 2003 , it seems the management has changed and the great big door has been replaced for a glass front ridding itself of the dark romantic getup .
target***It is small enough to fit in one of my purses !
target***Then I ' ve fixed the DC jack inside the unit , rewired the DC jack to the OUTside of the laptop , replaced the power brick .
target***My friend just had to replace his entire motherboard , so did my wife , and it looks like I will have to as well .
target***I bought mine from Apple Store the day it was released as Amazon did n't have it yet .
source***I love the place .
source***Yeah the crowd can take it a bit seriously , but it should n't .
target***Keyboard good sized and wasy to use .
source***Best Reuben sandwich ever !
source***I recommend their Pad See Ew , Pork Chops or Tofu plates .
source***I had my eyes on this place , promising myself I will one day give it a try ' .
source***To speak of the Park Side , words can not describe .
source***They never came back to refill our glasses again .
target***With a healthy pessimism , I took the machine home and tried to find a flaw .
source***Most importantly , food is excellent .
target***It is easy to find documents , and keep them in one area .
source***Secondly , on this night the place was overwhelmed by upper east side ladies perfume .
source***Great food at reasonable prices .
source***This is the Jackel and Hideof the restaurants on the UES .
source***It 's not mind - blowing , but to me , thai food never is and never will be .
target***This computer is good for 10 days then it sucks for the rest of your life .
target***She tells me about it all the time but I tend to shut off all cognitive functions when she gets that yapper going .
source***And it was quick which is very important .
target***Waiting for the i7 was well worth it , great value for the price .
source***I live a block away and go to Patsy 's frequently .
target***It was okay for over a week before the blue screens started occuring again .
target***This wiped out several programs that were installed on the computer when it was bought .
target***I bought this eMachines Notebook PC in January of this year and I am highly dissatisfied with it .
target***I have owned many different brands of laptops in my life .
source***Go inside and you wo n't want to leave .
target***I first purchased this Dell model 1764 on April 6 , 201
target***Then after 4 or so months the charger stopped working so I was forced to go out and buy new hardware just to keep this computer running .
source***All the food was hot tasty .
target***It really is perfect for work and play .
target***It has been plagued with problems since the day i turned it on .
source***All I can say is WOW !
source***Service is extraordinary , yet not overbearing , and the decor brings a taste of trendy SoHo into Queens .
source***The ingredients taste fresher , the crust is thinner and crispier , the slice is less oily , and it 's never burnt like it occasionally is at Joe 's .
target***Has a 5 - 6 hour battery life .
source***It is terrific , as is the value .
target***Just do n't waste your time and money on this .
source***I DO NOT RECOMMEND THE HEARTLAND BREWERY .
target***SO ? HOW CAN YOU SOLVE IT ? C'm on , I just bought the netbook 2 weeks ago .
source***Every course was better than the next .
source***Waiters are slow but sweet .
target***I purchased this netbook after my original Toshiba laptop crashed right after the warranty expired .
target***The Macbooks worth every penny .
target***Sadly Apple has discontinued this MacBook , I think it was never super popular since it fell somewhere in between the cheapest white model and the smaller Pros .
source***The drinks are a saving grace , but service staff , please , get over yourselves .
target***The touch pad is among the best .
target***Since I ' ve had this computer I ' ve only used the trackpad because it is so nice and smooth .
source***This place is cool enough to be in the East Village , but French enough to make you feel like you could be in a bistro in a back alley in Paris .
source***The garlic mashed potatoes are hands down the best in the city !
source***The dim sum servings here are a bit larger than I ' m used to .
source***The wine and cheese plate are plentiful and ca n't wait to try the fondue or table grilling .
source***Tell them Herky sent you and get a free confused look from the waiter .
source***Same owner as the guy who owns Typhoon , which is just down the street on St Marks and 1st Ave .
target***That includes transferring my music and movies .
source***Go to Volare for 1st class service and terrific food .
target***I definitely suggest getting an extended warranty , you will probably need it !
target***I can do pretty much 75 % of what I do on my desktop on my kitchen table .
target***Until I bought the Dell , I thought you just looked for what you wanted size , software , options , hardware and purchase the best deal you could find .
source***The dinner was ok , nothing I would have again .
target***It has served my needs quite nicely for the most part .
source***we were tired and cold when we got to the restaurant , then we sat down to begin ordering appetizers .
target***i would really recommend to any person out there to get this laptop cause its really worth it .
source***Walk - ins are risky too .
target***All the things you can do with the trackpad make navigating around the computer and its programs so much simpler , quicker , and easier .
source***Service is fast and friendly .
target***They don t translate from a Mac , even on Word , resulting in a ton of run - on sentences .
source***I have been going there since it opened and I ca n't get enough .
source***My roommate and I LOVE this place .
source***There is usually a wait but it is well worth it .
target***There are no viruses or spyware to worry about like on a Windows computer .
target***The Mac Book Pro performs flawlessly .
target***So , buyers beware !
source***The production is a symphony , alot of fun to experienceThe food sublime for the most part .
source***Their tuna tartar appetizer is to die for .
target***After a couple of years , my battery life began to diminish but was replaced for free due to a company - wide recall of my particular battery .
source***Oh right , I should probably say something nice .
target***She told me flatly , It 's like that one .
source***Bravo , Blue Hill !
source***Its not the same if you have to sit inside .
target***This little netboook is helping me get work done !
target***I have no idea how to burn cd 's or to use the web cam , just for starters .
target***iLife is easily compatible with Microsoft Office so you can send and receive files from a PC .
source***When I ' m feeling stressed by the noise and congestion around my office , I head for Cafe St Bart 's .
target***My MacBook Pro works like a dream , it has never overheated , or even been slightly warm for that matter .
target***After sending out documents via email and having recipients tell me they could not open the documents or they came through as gibberish , I broke down and spent another $ 100 to get Microsoft Word for Mac .
source***The menu is nothing like the one on the website .
target***Thank you .
target***But other than that I am blown away by all the features this laptop offers .
source***My friend from Milan and myself were pleasantly surprised when we arrived and everyone spoke italian .
source***I have been coming here for years and have nothing but good things to say about the service and the great staff at La Lanterna .
source***I highly recommend to anyone to give this place a try .
source***The entree was bland and small , dessert was not inspired .
target***Purchased as a gift for a friend .
target***1You can not change your desktop background window 's 7 starter does NOT support that function .
source***The bagel was huge .
target***I do n't have that additional money right now , and therefore would n't have purchased it at this time .
source***You do n't go to Mizu for excellent service , you go for the large amounts of food , the amiable atmosphere , and the hole - in - the - wall feeling of the place .
target***Long story short , since I experience so many problems with my laptop every since I bought it from day one , I did n't ask for a new laptop or a refund of what I pay for a crapy laptop , but just an extension of my laptop warranty for another year , they made a big deal of out that and after so many calls and complaints about their products and services , they finally gave in .
target***This machine rocks !
source***like saying her bread comes from a special bakery when we have seen her buying it dowtown manhathan .
target***I ' m going back to DELL .
target***HP is more interested in selling extended warranties which cost more than the netbook new then they are in helping or fixing .
target***If you 're looking for a great laptop , you ' ve found the best here .
source***Just do n't take the seat between the bar and the back half of the restaurant , i saw a woman get nudged 40times sitting there .
source***Pair you food with the excellent beers on tap or their well priced wine list .
target***I ' ve had my MacBook Pro for three years now and still love it !
source***Want to impress ?
source***It 's a nice place to relax and have conversation .
target***I purchased this laptop while on a business trip to keep up with my email .
target***might have to buy one for me now , since I use it all the time .
source***The fillings may be unconventional but the dosa batter is definitely authentic and the combinations very tasty .
source***Just moved to the neighborhood and we ' ve been trying all the West Village Sushi restaurants .
source***I have been doing all of the above at the Heartland Brewery for over 5 years now and I HAVE NEVER BEEN DISAPPOINTED !
source***I have been about 4 times and have always had a great meal .
target***There is no need to purchase virus protection for Mac , which saves me a lot of time and money .
source***THE FOOD PORTIONS ARE REALLY LARGE .
target***Just for a stupid CD .
target***But I am glad to have gotten mine right before they stopped making it .
target***They basically told me that the machine would be problem free now .
source***We generally like good restaurants and eat out often but Kai was way to expensive for what we got .
source***Delivery service is great too .
target***but it came back in even worse shape .
target***Very fast and efficient !
source***Went last Thursday .
target***If it 's not shipped on the next business day , called on a Friday they are closed on weekends , what was the next step .
source***Everything is always cooked to perfection , the service is excellent , the decor cool and understated .
target***Toshiba customer services will indirectly deal with your problems by constantly tranferring you from one country to another , and I am not kidding you , I called different hours of the day and you 'll get someone else from another country trying to get you to tell them your life story all over again , since they make it sound like they do n't have your history list of your calls right in front of them .
source***Even though the restaurant was packed , we were seated promptly and even asked for a table upstairs with no problems .
source***I noted it was crossed off on the bill .
target***Unless you want to be inconvenienced with a non working power supply which you ca n't find a replacement for because they made the attachment so small .
source***Service was very friendly .
source***As far as the service goes , the waitresses were not particularly friendly , but they got the job done .
target***Otherwise this little notebook has met all my expectations .
source***The ceiling is amazing !
source***The staff has always been attentive and kind , and I ' ve always been amazed at how they ' ve handled all the various different group sizes that come in .
target***I did not have to call the support line at all .
source***the real kicker of the menu , however , is the beef cubes or the chicken with chili and lemon grass .
target***I would n't play a first - person shooter with this , mind , but if you wanted to run MS Office , email , chat , download a video , listen to music from a certain fruit - named music store , and were looking for a highly portable yet powerful netbook to do that all in , I 'd highly recommend checking this out .
source***Having not been home in the last 2 years may skew this reviewer a bit , but the food was tasty and spicy sans the oil that comes floating along at similar venues .
source***The porcini mushroom pasta special was tasteless , so was the seafood tagliatelle .
target***Might not make the avid gamer happy but I do n't really think that is what this computer is designed for .
source***We had great desserts including the best cannoli I ' ve ever had and then they offered an after dinner drink , on the house .
source***At 6 , 30 , we were the third party there .
source***The food is ok , but not any better than what you get at a good neighborhood restaurant .
target***I thought it would be a simple job .
source***The food was terrific and the service classy , attentive , without being overbearing .
source***Very good service and very good prices .
source***Also a little more expensive than your average bagel place .
target***The screen takes some getting use to , because it is smaller than the laptop .
target***I took it back to the store and exchanged it for another one .
target***Had to have this computer repaired twice in the first 5 months after purchasing it .
target***THIS is what a laptop is supposed to be .
source***I ordered the chu chu curry and my friend ordered the pad thai chicken .
source***The prices are about $ 9 for an entree for dinner and even less for lunch .
source***The one up front will smile and say What can I get for you , brother ?
source***Zero ambiance to boot .
source***People are always friendly .
source***Skip this restaurant , it 's a big disappointment .
source***The food is inventive but still keeps traditional indian flavoring .
target***The cover for the DVD drive soon came off , too -- a mark of poor construction quality .
source***Nice atmosphere , the service was very pleasant and the desert was good .
source***Just wish they 'd expand .
source***I am happy i did the food was awsome .
source***It 's one of our favorite places to eat in NY .
target***but now i have realized its a problem with this brand .
source***Not what I wanted to hear .
source***great eats , good times .
source***Going to Ballato 's is like coming home and eating in my own kitchen , an absolute delight !
target***Buy it , love it , and I promise you wo n't regret it .
target***i think that anyone looking for a good durrable laptop then this is the way to go .
target***I also like that you can scroll down in a window using two fingers on the trackpad .
source***Orsay , is a very pleasnt throw back to traditional French food , and French service as well .
source***We went around 9 , 30 on a Friday and it had died down a bit by then so the service was great !
source***The Pad thai , lad nar and various other dishes all look good on paper but , I ' ve had better thai food in less asthetically pleasing places .
target***They have developed excellent proprietary software for editing video and pictures and I ' m looking forward to utilizing these tools on the regular .
target***But not in this case .
source***It may be a bit packed on weekends , but the vibe is good and it is the best French food you will find in the area .
target***May be better for the occasional web surfer .
target***I ' ve never had problems with viruses .
target***If this is an improvement in Customer Service then I would hate too see what it was before !
source***Mizu is home to creative and unique rolls not to found anywhere else .
target***Needless to say a PC that ca n't support a cell phone is less than useless !
source***BUt their best dish is thh Thai spiced curry noodles with shrimp , a dish that would cost $ 2395 is most places , but it is $ 16 here .
target***The keyboard has a wonderful nature feel .
source***The food is very good for it 's price , better than most fried dumplings I ' ve had .
source***Why do people rave about the ambience .
target***If you ever see the spinning beachball come up when you think it should n't , check the Activity Monitor app to see if the disk throughput has temporarily dropped to zero .
source***The food there are sastifying .
target***and they replaced the awesome ergonomic small lightweight power supply with a power supply that weighed more than the machine itself .
source***They 're terrific ! !
source***I particularly love their yellowfun tuna and their mussel selection .
source***The restuarant itself is not large , but seems to have several round tables to accomodate large groups hoping to save a buck to eat authentic Taiwanese .
source***Give it a try and enjoy .
source***I can not imagine better Indian food in all of the city .
source***Despite a slightly limited menu , everything prepared is done to perfection , ultra fresh and a work of food art .
target***This is what they told me , It heats up , and that is the reason we no longer call them laptops , and simply categorize them as portables .
target***For one , I noticed that from turning on my mac to logging on only took about 25 seconds .
target***Do n't waste your money or time .
source***I recieved prompt service with a smile .
source***But $ 1 for each small piece ? ? ?
target***My Iphone synced right up just like a person would expect , unlike the PCs in our lives .
source***Ambience is so cute and quaint , good for business although we were there on vacation .
target***Not a bad laptop , it 's a bit slow , but gets the job done .
target***I just recently had to ship my laptop back to HP for repair .
source***and that 's saying a lot .
target***That included the extra Sony Sonic Stage software , the speakers and the subwoofer I got that WAS worth the money , the bluetooth mouse for my supposedly bluetooth enabled computer , the extended life battery and the Docking port .
target***They removed them and returned the computer to me .
target***Lightweight and the screen is beautiful !
target***I have not had a problem with the applications quitting or freezing .
target***Again windows based machines were not giving me anything to work with !
source***they did n't disappoint , service from the second i arrived at the door was extremely pleasant and attentive with almost one server per table .
source***It is LOUD , HOT and DARK .
source***Our server checked on us maybe twice during the entire meal .
source***They have a huge selection of different cream cheeses and all of their salads are great .
target***This MacBook is an outstanding product with great value .
source***The food was spicy and delicious .
target***Overall I am very satisfied with the purchase .
target***Oh my goodness - I am not a happy camper .
target***The perfect notebook .
target***It 's color is even cool .
target***I will never buy another HP computer .
source***Yes , there might be a wait if you have no reservations .
source***A touch more jalapeno heat for contrast and it would have been very good indeed .
target***I ve owned Apple computers and laptops for as long as i could remember .
source***The waitstaff are all very busy , it 's not outstanding service , but I ' ve never been dealt with rudely .
source***The service is spotty , sometimes really friendly and sometimes barely there .
source***I have been here a few times for dinner , once for brunch and twice for lunch .
source***The wine the service was very good too .
target***However , a NETBOOK will be a different story .
source***Some baby pizzas get their wish .
target***Battery is not upgradable to a longer life battery .
source***You ca n't go wrong here .
source***i would go again if i did n't have to pay .
source***Cute and decorative .
source***First of all Dal Bukhara Rocks .
source***This restaurant used to be our regular Thursday night dinner location .
source***Suan was a recommendation that I am glad we heeded .
source***When we arrived at 6 , 00 PM , the restaurant was practically empty .
source***At first I was slightly skeptical because it was a sushi restaurant in the middle of NYC .
source***Much of the time it seems like they do not care about you .
source***The only concern i have is with the slighly all - business waitstaff who order and throw the food down , rushing you out .
target***Then they had me jump through many hoops and questions to see if they could find another way to invalidate me .
target***Other Thoughts , Do not purchase this product .
source***All in all the food was above average and I would return to see how they operate with four or less dinners .
source***I really liked this place .
source***moral stay away .
target***I definitely will buy a Mac again if and when this computer ever fails .
source***This place has the best Chinese style BBQ ribs in the city .
target***I would highly recommend this one to my friends
source***They 're also friendlier here , especially the owner , Kenny .
target***but after i got used to it i love it .
source***Something about them being busy with holiday party 's .
source***For those that go once and do n't enjoy it , all I can say is that they just do n't get it .
target***His was worth $ 36 .
target***You know , using the computer should be fun , not aggrevation , especially when you are playing games or working with photos .
source***Priced at upper intermediate range .
target***Never any doubt I would get a MacBook , just was n't sure which one .
source***This place has realy fresh sushi and a nice large menu of Japanese classic cuisine .
target***2 Blue screen first month
target***You wo n't have to spend gobs of money on some inefficient virus program that needs to be updated every month and that constantly drains your wallet .
source***Would recommend this place as a good date spot if you do n't want to drop a ton of cash .
source***Made my dining experience uncomfortable .
source***Eating at Ottimo is like eating in Chef Salvatore Esposito 's home .
target***After about another month I had to send it in AGAIN to Acer for repairs .
target***Although my model was listed as recalled , HP denied my claim .
target***Info , Windows failed to load because the kernal is missing , or corrupt .
source***The well mannered , pleasant staff that Tony has in his employ .
source***The one vegetarian entree Abby 's treasure was actually quite a surprise , it was delicious and had wintermelon covering an assortment of fresh mushrooms and vegetables .
source***The service is awful -- the last time I was there and I do mean the last time we were told that they needed our table so we would have to leave .
source***Do n't waste money on decor .
source***I would highly recommend this place to everyone for any occasion !
target***I ' ve always used PC 's for work home and this is my first experience with a Mac .
source***This is the kind of place you 'd like to take all your friends to and still keep a secret .
source***Its not curry in a slurry crap , and regular run of the mill food .
target***It 's a great prodcut to handle basic computing needs .
target***The screen is huge and coloful , but no LED backlighting .
target***Exactly that , users .
target***That being said , it still runs video in full screen decently .
target***I would never tell anyone to buy one either .
source***The flavors robust and subtle .
target***no complaints with their desktop , and maybe because it just sits on your desktop , and you do n't carry it around , which could jar the hard drive , or the motherboard .
target***Summary , I ' ve had this laptop for 2 months , out of the blue the power adapter stops working .
target***I ve had several calls lasting more than an hour with promises to call back , but the return calls never came .
source***But the main hit was the whole grilled fish .
source***I love to visit Murrays for my bagel fix .
target***I or my dad paid over twenty four hundred dollars for everything .
target***Money and time well spent !
target***I have had it for about a 1 1/2 and yes I have had an issue with it one month out of warranty .
target***I really wanted a Mac over a pc because I used a Mac in high school .
target***It was also cheaper than the Pro which made it even more appealing to me .
source***If only they delivered , they 'd make a mint !
target***It is light and the battery last a very long time .
target***The internet capabilities are also very strong and picks up signals very easily .
source***For all of you new to Indian food , try the Paneer Roll , it is a piece of heaven .
source***Food was okay , nothing great .
source***Really tasty spring rolls and noodles for a good price though .
target***after trying to get some help he disconnected on me .
source***Jimmy 's is hands down the hottest night spot in the Bronx .
target***The case is carved out of a single block of aluminum .
source***Deliveries often take up to an hour and the prices are higher than most other pizzerias in the area .
source***The food here does a great service to the name Cantonese that is .
target***If you have the money I suggest going for the i7 .
target**** 3 weeks after giving the computer for repair*-Visited MacHouse Amsterdam .
target***Again , the same problem , the right speaker did not work .
target***I hope to edit this in the next few hours , I am going to try to install my own copy of Windows 7 .
target***I believe that the quality of a mac is worth the price .
target***I have had to send in my laptop three times to get it fixed .
source***They all know you .
source***After passing by this restaurant for sometime I finally decided to go in and have dinner .
source***It 's simply the best meal in NYC .
source***Besides that there should be more restaurants like it around the city .
target***I have owned many computers and laptops .
target***Also , if you need to talk to a representive at Microsoft , there is a charge , which I believe is robbery , since you are charged enormous amounts for a very badly designed system , which most people would have went with XP if they could .
target***The real stand out on this computer is the feel of the keyboard and it 's speed .
target***TOSHIBA WILL NOT ACKNOWLEDGE THIS PROBLEM .
target***It works really well .
target***Overall for the money this is a good deal .
target***Laptop is advertised as a 15 " but the casing looks like that of a 17 " .
target***Even if Apple replaces whatever needs replacing I wonder if , since I seem to be doubling the amount of time I get out of it each time it 's like new , I might have 8 months next time .
source***This place started off a little iffy , but is now one of my favorite indian restaurants in NYC and I ' m indian , so I should know .
source***The dim sum is delectable while the prices are quite easy on the wallet .
source***great for a romantic evening , or a fun evening with friends .
target***The layout of the MacBook is horrible and confusing ;
target***So you do n't get frustrated the first few weeks .
source***While the prices are nothing special , the portions are huge .
source***Its a nice quiet location to go eat a good meal , relax , be able to talk and have a very good time .
source***I just do n't understand all the hype .
source***My friends and I experienced amazing cheese and a delicious , new summer menu at Artisanal last night .
source***Stay away from the two specialty rolls on the menu , though too much avocado and rice will fill you up right quick .
target***I shopped around before buying .
source***The bar is very well stocked with interesting beers and well priced wines .
source***Similar to other Indian restaurants , they use the dinner special to attract customers at the door .
source***How do you rate home ?
target***Needs longer lasting battery , More than 1 to 2 Hrs .
target***I simply got tired of a bad computer like windows with its constant freezing and anti - virus .
source***i hang out , and live , in the neighborhood .
target***It rarely works and when it does it 's incredibly slow .
target***even though I had the receipt in front of me proving it still had 2 months left on the warranty .
source***The service was great as well .
target***You better believe my next computer will be a MAC !
target***This laptop is very large and barely fits in any carrying cases .
target***i can use it for all of my needs .
target***As well as having the plug in the computer come loose .
source***Tends to turn people away .
source***i ' m surprised about some of the bad reviews posted here , i ' ve been to tamarind about 5 or 6 times and always come away extremely satisfied and looking forward to returning .
target***Skype is just so dang cool with this machine too .
target***Note that I do n't ordinarily take the time to write a review .
source***Try the olive cream cheese or the lox spread on a whole wheat everything bagel .
target***It quit working within a weeks time .
source***We were fast to order the appetizer platter since we were very hungry .
target***Needless to say I told them No and have a nice day and hung up !
target***The display is incredibly bright , much brighter than my PowerBook and very crisp .
source***The food always tastes fresh and served promptly .
source***I really like both the scallops and the mahi mahi ( on saffron risotto ! .
source***My husbands was perfect , my was well done and dry .
source***We figured we never had Argentinian Pizza before so we grabbed our lunch there , sharing a large Pelligrino , a pizza of two of their specials , one was goat cheese the other blue cheese , and both were excellent .
target***It can not save the correct date and time I set .
source***While the room is not particularly comfortable , once you 're seated you 'll forget about everything except what 's on your plate .
source***Service was on par but not wonderful .
source***The food was just awful , ATROCIOUS actually .
target***My wireless system would not recognize Windows 7 and I could n't get online to find out why .
target***It 's graphics are n't bad at all , for the lower end of the MacBook Pro spectrum , easily capable of running StarCraft II and other games with comparable graphics .
source***Went with mommy the only person who could afford taking me here .
source***Barbecued codfish was gorgeously moist , as if poached , yet the fabulous texture was let down by curiously bland seasoning , a spice rub might have overwhelmed , however herb mix or other sauce would have done much to enhance .
source***I plan to come here again and look forward to trying their assortment of bruschetta , panini 's .
target***If what you need is a machine to do some surfing , email checking , word processing , and watching a movie or two , this is the machine you want .
source***The food was mediocre at best but it was the horrible service that made me vow never to go back .
source***Maybe it was just an unintentional mistake but I ' ve experienced the same with other restaurants so I do n't appreciate such practice .
target***The large screen gives you the option to comfortably watch movies or TV shows on your computer instead of buying an additional TV for your dorm room .
target***Most of my papers could not be saved and when they could be , half the time , the papers were then erased .
target***This is what I call a good after sales service .
target***After having two PC laptops die with in the past 3 years , I was led to the Apple display at Best Buy by the sleek design and promise of less tech issues .
source***I ' ve never been disappointed .
target***It is so nice not to worry about that and the extra expense that comes along with the necessary virus protection on PC 's .
source***We thought that this place is using too much of MSG cooking in the foods .
source***So some of the reviews here are accurate about the crowd and noise .
source***Since it literally is a complete hole in the wall , it 's a bit intimidating at first , but you get over that very quickly as soon as the friendly staff welcomes you , do n't hesitate to ask for help with what to get .
target***, In the past four years I ' ve had it I have never once gotten a virus .
target***Who knows what will happen later on when they dismantle the whole damn thing ? So , I said I wanted a new set .
target***Even with virus protection , it always turned off when updates were needed and installed .
source***I ' ve ordered from the 2nd ave .
source***We happened upon this place purely by accident and were pleased with the results .
target***Basic computer .
source***Everytime my husband and I go there , we are never disappointed .
source***You are paying for the atmosphere , which is nice , but can be had in numerous places in Bay Ridge .
target***It is also very lightweight , making transporting this computer very easy .
source***Southern Indian cuisine is still there , too .
target***Call tech support , standard email the form and fax it back in to us .
source***Told us to sit anywhere , and when we sat he said the table was reserved .
target***The AMD Turin processor seems to always perform so much better than Intel .
target***If anything , I would only suggest using one of these laptops if only you have to .
source***The prices were fantastic .
target***I love the way the entire suite of software works together .
target***That 's the downside for me .
target***Well , they do n't care a bunch .
source***They are opening two more places as i saw a flyer there one in Yonkers which is a restraunt and banquet hall and another one in parsipanny new jersey .
source***The menu seemed to have a wide variety of dishes for seafood lovers and interesting ways of preparing them .
target***The display is awesome .
