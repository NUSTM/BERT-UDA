the menu options are uncreative , as you can ' t see a full screen of menu items to pick from ; you have to scroll up and down to find what you 're looking for ( yes , this is minor , but not when you 're trying to keep your eye on the road ! ) .***O T-NEG T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O***DT NNP NNS VBP JJ , IN PRP MD '' NN VB DT JJ NN IN NN NNS TO VB IN : PRP VBP TO VB RP CC RB TO VB WP PRP VBP VBG IN -LRB- UH , DT VBZ JJ , CC RB WRB PRP VBP VBG TO VB PRP$ NN IN DT NN . -RRB- .
