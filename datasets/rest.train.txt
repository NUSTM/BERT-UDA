Taking Hot Dogs to the next level***O T-POS T-POS O O O O***VBG NNP NNS IN DT JJ NN
At first glance this place seems a bit pricey for a hot dog joint , but at Bark you do n't just get your average hot dog .***O O O O O O O O O O O T-POS T-POS O O O O T-NEG O O O O O O O T-POS T-POS O***IN JJ NN DT NN VBZ DT NN JJ IN DT JJ NN NN , CC IN NNP PRP VBP RB RB VB PRP$ JJ JJ NN .

Appetizers took nearly an hour .***O O O O O O***NNS VBD RB DT NN .
When the main course finally arrived another 45mins half of our order was missing .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O***WRB DT JJ NN RB VBD DT NNP NN IN PRP$ NN VBD VBG .
Never got an explanation as to what was going on .***O O O O O O O O O O O***RB VBD DT NN IN IN WP VBD VBG RP .

When we threatened to leave , we were offered a meager discount even though half the order was missing .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O***WRB PRP VBD TO VB , PRP VBD VBN DT JJ NN RB IN PDT DT NN VBD VBG .
On the way out , we heard of other guests complaining about similar issues .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O***IN DT NN RB , PRP VBD IN JJ NNS VBG IN JJ NNS .

What a hassle !***O O O O***WDT DT NN .
The food is very good , but not outstanding .***O T-NEU O O O O O O O O***DT NN VBZ RB JJ , CC RB JJ .
There is no way it justifies the accolades it receives , the attitude of the staff or the wait for a table .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG O O T-NEG O O O O***EX VBZ DT NN PRP VBZ DT NNS PRP VBZ , DT NN IN DT NN CC DT NN IN DT NN .
On our last visit , they skipped over our name on the list , leaving us waiting an extra hour for a table .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O***IN PRP$ JJ NN , PRP VBD IN PRP$ NN IN DT NN , VBG PRP VBG DT JJ NN IN DT NN .
Mistakes happen , but they are usually accompanied by an apology , perhaps even a glass of winebut not the grunt that we received from the Al Di La staff .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG O***NNS VBP , CC PRP VBP RB VBN IN DT NN , RB RB DT NN IN NN RB DT NN WDT PRP VBD IN DT NNP NNP NNP NN .
Without the wait or attitude , I would probably go back , but there are just too many other restaurants in Brooklyn that are as good or better and do n't make me jump through hoops .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O***IN DT NN CC NN , PRP MD RB VB RB , CC EX VBP RB RB JJ JJ NNS IN NNP WDT VBP RB JJ CC JJR CC VB RB VB PRP VB IN NNS .
Expensive***O***JJ
I went there after hearing how great it was .***O O O O O O O O O O***PRP VBD RB IN VBG WRB JJ PRP VBD .
Wow .***O O***UH .
The bread was stale , the salad was overpriced and empty .***O T-NEG O O O O T-NEG O O O O O***DT NN VBD JJ , DT NN VBD VBN CC JJ .
The pasta was well cooked , did n't have enough sauce though or flavor .***O T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O***DT NN VBD RB VBN , VBD RB VB JJ NN IN CC NN .

The only thing that my friend left out is that when we sat down at the bar the bartender disappeared .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG O O***DT JJ NN WDT PRP$ NN VBD RP VBZ IN WRB PRP VBD RP IN DT NN DT NN VBD .

I was there for brunch recently , and we were tag teamed by a waitress and a waiter .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG O O T-NEG O***PRP VBD RB IN NN RB , CC PRP VBD NN VBN IN DT NN CC DT NN .
The waiter delivered our food while holding what appeared to be a plastic bag of garbage in one hand .***O T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O***DT NN VBD PRP$ NN IN VBG WP VBD TO VB DT JJ NN IN NN IN CD NN .
I ca n't believe that it was , but please put the bag down before delivering food !***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O***PRP MD RB VB IN PRP VBD , CC UH VB DT NN RP IN VBG NN .
The waitress came to check in on us every few minutes , and began to clear the plates while half of us were still eating a big pet peeve of mine that happens almost everywhere , so I try to ignore it .***O T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O***DT NN VBD TO VB RP IN PRP DT JJ NNS , CC VBD TO VB DT NNS IN NN IN PRP VBD RB VBG DT JJ JJ NN IN NN WDT VBZ RB RB , RB PRP VBP TO VB PRP .
I could n't ignore the fact that she reach over the plate of one of my friends , who was in mid bite , to clear the table .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O***PRP MD RB VB DT NN IN PRP VBP IN DT NN IN CD IN PRP$ NNS , WP VBD IN JJ NN , TO VB DT NN .
She then put the check down without asking if we were done , and came to check on the bill every two minutes , even though we were one of three occupied tables .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O***PRP RB VBD DT NN RP IN VBG IN PRP VBD VBN , CC VBD TO VB IN DT NN DT CD NNS , RB IN PRP VBD CD IN CD VBN NNS .
